This is not a good start to the day
As you say.
I ve got so much to do today, you know there are tight deadlines for that project
Let's see if anything happens quickly.
This lift is often breaking,
I wish I had climbed the stairs
It's true that this project is late.
I don't know how much it's your fault, but if we stay stuck in that elevator long, you can work there.
I know you have your computer with you, it's perfect.
Do you do a lot of sports?
Oh you are so funny
You do push my buttons sometimes
What are you thinking I should be able to climb twenty floors because I m so fit?
I don't know exactly which floor if you find your office, you know.
There are several hundred employees in this company, can't I know the location of everyone's office?
I appreciate that
Anyway, I always take the elevator.
And by some miracle it never broke down with me in it again.
Until now.
But if you concentrated on getting a good maintenance contract with the lift engineers we would not be on this position
Yes, I know I've been renewing this contract for a long time.
But, you know, my schedule is absolutely full, I never have time to deal with these practical details.
I'll have to ask Archibald to handle this urgently.
Okay, we talk, we talk, but we're still stuck.
I'm gonna push the backup button.
I pushed the emergency button half an hour ago
Nothing is happening
Are you picking up the network with your phone?
I ve also tried my phone but that is not connecting
Neither is mine.
Well, we need to figure this out.
Do you know how to scream very loud, or sing very loud?
I am getting fed up now
Yeah, me too, to be honest.
If we have to stay here much longer, you can work.
I only have my book, and I'm almost done.
Well I can tell you for nothing I am not going to work in here
Anyway, I'm glad it's you that I'm stuck in this elevator, and not Archibald.
He would have been unbearable.
He would have yelled at me, with no respect for his boss.
I m very tempted to yell too
Maybe I will and someone might hear us and come to the rescue
Yes, go ahead, we can try!
Aaaaaaah,
You're shaking, are you okay?
Hello, yes I'm feeling very anxious.
This is my first time flying and I'm not sure what to expect.
Really?
It's my first time, too, it's crazy!
I'm pretty stressed, too, you know that a plane went down just yesterday in Texas?
So we're in the same situation.
That's terrible and knowing that doesn't help my nerves.
My doctor has given me some pills to calm me down but they don't seem to be working.
Tell me about it, I'm sure it's a placebo what he gave you.
Look, my hands are shaking, too.
What a pair we are!
Maybe a drink will calm us.
Good idea!
How about a whiskey?
That sounds good.
Or if they haven't got a whiskey, a brandy.
Are you travelling for work or a holiday?
I'm going to a seminar on the fear of the plane.
I hope it helps!
Maybe they'll give us a drink!
Your seminar sounds interesting.
I'm visiting a friend.
I hope she's there to collect me when I arrive.
The test of your seminar will be when you have to fly back!
Oh, no.
Your friend will probably be here, why?
Unless she has a car accident, of course.
Well I hope not, otherwise I don't know what I'll do!
I'll be all alone in a strange country.
And I don't speak the language.
You're not talking about the Lithuanian?
Don't worry, I'm sure we'll all be there, your friend there.
Fingers crossed.
Enjoy your seminar.
Thank you!
He's scheduled to be completely in Lithuanian, and I will understand nothing.
Never mind.
Hello, what can you lose in this evil forest?
How are you planning on getting out of this?
I'm scared.
I don't know.
You look like you know the outdoors better than me.
I've already cut my knee on a twig and grazed my head too.
That's sad!
But don't worry!
The medicinal herbs will allow you to heal and get back on your feet!
We're going to get these herbs and try to make it an ointment.
Then we can try to call for help by building a musical instrument.
'cause here I don't have a signal
Do you?
No.
But why a musical instrument?
Wouldn't a wolf whistle work better?
Because an instrument allows us to communicate remotely without a signal.
Based on the traditional method of communication, we might be able to get us out of this wrong.
I'm not sure what a wrong is, but if you really think you can do it, go ahead.
What kind of instrument were you thinking of?
A wooden one I suppose...
We can make a Tam Tam, but we need buffalo skin!
Or make a cry for help with a big fire.
We can use the smoke to communicate in Morse code.
You're full of ideas today!
But you do seem a bit unrealistic.
Unless you know of a buffalo shop around here?
Although you may be onto something with your idea of the fire.
Haha, there's no store like this.
But, yes, fire can serve us.
Do you have any other ideas that come to mind?
Because moving blind with a wounded knee doesn't seem like a good idea to me.
We could just sit here and wait for somebody to find us.
I'm tired.
I could watch you make a fire!
Now that's a good idea!
Why bother?
I'm never going to pass, so I might as well give up now.
You have all the ability to succeed.
Don't be discouraged.
How do you know that?
You're not in my head!
Your copies and your questions show that you're brilliant.
I bet you say that to everybody.
I'm rubbish at maths, rubbish at science.
And I just glued my hand to the desk in Art.
There's an internship next week.
He might make you feel better.
You can ask all the questions that will be left after your studying this weekend.
What do you mean?
Who am I going to ask?
I don't even think I'll have any questions 'cause I understand so little.
All the teachers will be available.
Start with simple questions.
Why me?
Like that?
On top of that, there will be cake in this review internship.
As a consolation, right?
And, seriously, do you ever really use anything you learnt in class?
We'll leave the basics if we need to, but we can't give up.
Wow, I thought you would tell me that we need the basics!
Are you sure about that?
On what part of the program do you think you're lost?
Where do I start?
It's a bit embarrassing, but I've never been any good at my times tables...
The multiplication tables?
Yeah, I know it's stupid.
But my teacher back in school used to spend all her time knitting in class and would never explain anything properly.
And now, years later, look where I am!
So we'll take a little time every day of the next week to review tables.
What other parts of the program seem to be difficult?
You would do that for me?
Wow, you're the first teacher who's ever done anything nice for me!
I do struggle with French too...
I just can't get the grammar.
My teacher keeps telling me that I sound like I'm translating word by word.
Which is sort of true...
Maybe you can use a computer translator to help you?
There's some more advanced software in the field.
Isn't that cheating?
They might notice if I bring my laptop to the exam.
I always have some leftover bread and I like to come here and enjoy the quiet.
And you?
What brings you here?
Hello, yes it's a lovely day.
I work from home and it's nice to get out and be with people as it's quite lonely not seeing anyone all day.
That's for sure!
What do you do for a living?
My favourite water bird is the swan.
They're nesting over there and it looks as if the babies will hatch out soon.
I'm a journalist, so a very solitary profession.
I prefer ducks, I think that swans can be mean.
But it's true that babies are cute.
Yes the swans can be quite aggressive.
The ducks are pretty, particularly the males.
What do you do for a living?
Journalist, must be a tough job, huh?
I'm a computer computer, and I work from home, too.
The advantage is freedom.
It can be difficult at times, particularly when I have too many deadlines, but it's rewarding when you see your article in print.
You print under an alias or your real name?
Yes there is that.
I can do the odd jobs round the house in-between writing.
I use an alias, as there are a lot of weird people out there.
It protects me from social media intrusion.
What does your job involve?
I'm developing software for companies.
I specialize in artificial intelligence.
But I also do Web development, it pays the bills.
I guess it saves you from being harassed.
What subjects do you write about?
Medicine and healthcare and our National Health Service which is always in the news for not having enough money to keep it going
Your job sounds very interesting
That's a real problem.
If we keep it that way, we'll go into the wall, for sure.
It's not bad and varied as work!
It's pretty cool in every day, it's true.
I'm gonna have to leave you two alone.
I'm out of bread and it's getting late.
It's been a pleasure.
Thanks for chatting.
Enjoy the rest of your day
You too, see you soon.
You don't look so good.
I'm not feeling too well.
This is my first time flying.
Really?
Don't worry, everything's going to be fine!
How can you be so sure?!
Are you an engineer?
No, but the engineers who do the planes know what they're doing!
And pilots!
That's what pilots do, not anyone you know!
They do years and years of studying!
true.
but it is still very scary.
have you ever flown in a plane before?
Yes, I take the plane very often.
Look out the window!
Look how beautiful it is, this sea of clouds...
really?!
Does it get any easier?
wow!
the clouds are beautiful but we are so high up!
a sea of clouds to drown in
It's poetic what you say, but it's not very positive!
Let's see, a little bit of courage.
All we have is 1 2: 30.
i'm sorry, i'm just not used to being in a plane.
12:30... i don't get it?
I mean, before we get to Australia, we've only got 12 or 13 hours left.
It's quiet, isn't it?
12 or 13 hours?!
are you kidding me?!
Oh sweet jesus.
we're all going to die
Haha!
You know, the length doesn't change anything!
Statistically, accidents usually happen at takeoff or landing.
Thanks for your help.
I'm going to talk to someone who actually cares.
As you wish.
Go on, have fun!
Hello Sandra, I have something to ask you for the next class
Can't you ask me now, I might not be here at the next class
The weather is so nice I fancy taking a day off
I remind you that class is required.
You'll be enjoying the weather in a few weeks.
But I can revise outside, there is not a lot of point being stuck in here
Besides the weather might break
Especially for next week, I need you to do a presentation on your favorite subject:
I usually do most of my homework and I do turn up generally
And what do you think is my favourite subject?
I'm sure, given the quality of your memory on this subject, that you are passionate about the future of worms.
I want all of the students to benefit from your expertise.
I could sing a funny English song about dead bodies, the worms go in and the worms go out
I ll have to try and remember it from when I was younger
Have you been drinking?
I remind you we're in college!
I'm not interested in child songs.
It would be funny though and it would get other students to pay attention
Often students fall asleep so something to grab their attention might be just the thing
Oh and no I ve not been drinking, not even tequila with a worm in the bottom of the bottle!
I see you have a lot of mind.
We'll see if you have so much on the next exam!
I warn you, I'll be particularly demanding towards you.
I just checked and you can find the song on you tube 'the hearse song'
Do listen, you might enjoy it.
You don't smile very often
I appreciate your advice, but I remind you that I'm the teacher, and you're the student.
So I'm the one giving the advice.
And now, I advise you to work hard and come next week with a report for your comrades.
Maybe we should have some tequila together and that may help our relationship
Your offer makes me very uncomfortable.
I'd rather stop this conversation.
See you in a week, your job will have better be good!
Hi, how are you?
It's been a few weeks since we've seen each other.
I am ok, I find some of the other residents a bit annoying
you are very kind to visit me so often
Really?
You don't find conversation issues with them?
They can be much older than you.
I don't think its an age thing, its an attitude of mind
I don't know why some old people have to grumble and moan so much
it is dispiriting
I understand.
But do you guys have any activities where you're all together: Walk, board games, shows...?
We do have various activities, but sing-a-long war time songs, I ask you!!
Just because we are old does not mean we have lost all sense of taste
No, of course.
I hope in this case you go out, even alone, take walks.
And I hope you still play the guitar!
My hands are a bit too arthritic now for making music but my grandson does visit and play for me sometimes
The staff are very strict about allowing residents to go out on their own
they worry about health and safety; falls etc and then having to fill in lots of paperwork I guess
That's very nice of your grandson.
Even if the staff is strict, for security reasons, you still get along well with them?
they are fine and I make them laugh
you know I ve a wicked sense of humour, mind you, I am not sure they always get me
If you make them laugh, it's a good sign.
What about the food?
I remember you telling me she wasn't so good.
I can bring you some cookies if you want!
Oooh I love cookies, yes please.
I thik the cook thinks everybody has dodgy false teeth or even no teeth at all
the food is just mushy
Well, it doesn't have to be too bad.
There's a restaurant nearby, you could go from time to time, even if the staff doesn't like to go out.
What a surprise to see you.
Were you passing by or have you made a special trip to see me?
I came to see you.
It's been over a month since we met.
How are you?
Health?
I'm very well thank you.
The doctor gave me a check-up last week and said I was as fit as a fiddle.
Not bad for someone eighty five years old.
I've just had my lunch but would you like me to ask someone to get a cup of tea or coffee for you?
It makes me happy to know your health is good.
Yes, I'll have a cup of coffee.
And how are things here?
Are you always so satisfied with your retirement home?
I think I remember that the food is not very good.
I'll ring the bell to get someone to get you a coffee.
I was apprehensive about moving here from my old house, but I have settled in now.
There is no way that I could have stayed any longer at home and looked after myself
The food though is not very good.
Yeah, that's what I remember about food.
Do you go out once in a while?
I hope the retirement home is about various activities.
I go out once a week.
They arrange a mini-bus which takes us somewhere interesting.
last week we had a trip to Windsor Castle.
There are activities too.
I can throw a ball to other people here or I can go to poetry classes.
It is very varied.
Oh, right.
And here even there's nothing?
It seems to me that the last time a lecturer was supposed to be speaking of ancient Egypt.
And the music?
You still playing the piano, I hope?
I do play the piano so,
I do the piano sometimes.
And once in a while someone comes in to entertain us.
Anyway, that's enough about me.
How are you doing?
I'm fine and hoping to be as alert as you at 85 years old!
That's good to know.
I hope you can come again.
Have a good journey home and send
My best wishes to your family
Good evening, my dear!
How are you?
How was your day?
Hello!
I'm so glad to be home
I've had a horrible day
Oh, my poor darling.
What happened to you?
I had to go to this retirement home and see an old friend and pretend to be in love with him, just to try and get his money in his will
He is on his last legs you see
And we so badly need the money
But it smelt so badly of old people there - I'm glad to be home
How was your day, sweet one?
I'm fine, nothing special.
Was it your dad's old friend, the kind of pervert who looks at all the girls with his fat-ass eyes?
Yes, it was him!
There was a poor girl there called Anya who we wouldn't leave alone
She said afterwards to me she was going to get a restraining order against him
I remember him, and it's true that he was always looking at you in a very inappropriate way.
A young girl who works at the nursing home?
Poor thing, spending her life in the middle of old, frustrated and old.
Yes, but I never minded.
He is so rich, I always thought I would get something out of it when he passed away.
But now this Anya seems to be getting in there instead
I don't feel that sorry for Anya, he will leave her lots of money I imagine
In a way, she's gonna deserve it.
But we really don't have much money these days.
I know, but who's fault is that?
You do like to gamble and drink a lot
Yes, those are my little pleasures.
But you also like a few glasses of good French wine for drinks.
You have to enjoy life.
You could try to convince the big pervert this Anya only wants her money, and that you're the only person who really loves her!
That could work, old people are sometimes very paranoid.
What a good idea!
I need to turn him against Anya, and show him what a money-grabber she is
Exactly!
I might go call him now and start planting the seed of that idea
Awesome!
Soon, we will not be poor anymore!
In the meantime, shall we open a bottle?
Oh go on then, we do deserve it I suppose, it's been such a hard day
Good evening, how was your day?
Rubbish... I got soaked on the way to work, and then there was no way to dry my stuff, so I've been walking around in damp clothes all day.
I just want to take a long hot shower and have a beer.
How about you?
How was your day?
My poor baby, he was all wet all day long, I hope you didn't catch cold.
I told you to dress up.
The mini-skirt and the summer shoes, in April and in a long time, it's a risk.
I stayed warm with the dog.
As long as you're not asking me to watch football and warm up a frozen pizza, you can stay as long as you want in the shower and drink your beer.
Yeah, but they're so comfortable, and when I left the house the sun way shining!
Ouf... I wish I could have spent the day at home with the dog...
He makes far better company than the people at work.
You know I can't stand the football, and frozen pizza... I'd rather order in Indian food
Will you order it while I'm in the shower... I'll have my usual.
Since you're all wet, take the time to get the dog out, I'll run you a bath and order Indian.
Ok, it can't really make it any worse than it already is, and it's not good for him to be inside all day!
You're kidding, he's an apartment dog, when I tried to get him out in the rain, he just wouldn't come out, he just peed on the corner, and he was already shooting on his leash to get home.
He didn't used to be, you've spoiled him way too much!
He needs to get used to bad weather, we are planning to move to the west coast of Brittany after all!
Not at all, you plan to move to Lapland.
I'm a sensitive and fragile character, just like my little dog.
In any case the weather in Lapland is wonderful.
I like the sun.
I hate this country, or it does a terrible time 9 months a year.
It is far less humid and the northern lights are beautiful.
Maybe for popsicles, but not for me.
I want sun.
I will always be on a cruise to the polar circle, where to attend the white parties of St. Petersburg, but not to live north of 45-th parallel.
Excuse me, north of 45th parallel.
You want me to bring your beer in your bath?
Ooh, yeah please!
That would be great :)
Ok, I'm going to head out with the dog!
See you in a bit
Okay.
Hello.
What can I get you?
Coffee and orange juice.
OK.
Is that a small orange juice?
And would you like ice in it?
How would you like your coffee?
Cappuccio?
Flat White?
Americano?
More like a big glass of squeezed orange juice, no ice.
Yes I can do that for you.
It will take a minute to squeeze the orange juice.
It's a white coffee, because I've never tasted it.
What's it like?
It's very good - the best in town!
I'll make you some and you can see what you think.
Are you visiting the town/ I don't think I have seen you in here before.
All right;
Yes, I'm just passing through this town for a work meeting.
What's interesting to see?
The art gallery is interesting.
They have a special exihibition at the moment on Vincent Van Gogh.
Or you could visit the cathedral.
Where the art and the cathedral are located.
Is it far from here?
The art gallery is just a hundred metres from the bar.
Turn left and you will find it.
The cathedral is a bit further.
All right.
Otherwise, I just had a taste of your white-mouth coffee.
Not so good.
What do you put in it?
Maple syrup?
It's a special recipe.
I'm not allowed to say!
Can I get you something else instead?
No, thanks.
Do you have any other special recipes here?
Otherwise, I'd like a little sugar and a straw for my orange juice.
No other special recipes.Only coffee English style.
Would you like to sit at a table and i will bring your orange juice over to you?
Yes, thank you.
RIght I'll do that and then I need to serve the customer who has just come in.
I hope you enjoy the orange juice and get to see the art gallery.
Thanks very much for your custom.
Hello my dear, it's been a while!
Oh, how nice of you to come to me!
It's true, it's been a long time.
How are you?
You look great!
Aww thank you, that's so kind of you to say!
I don't feel so great though sadly.
I am not as young as I used to be
I feel like I'm starting to fall apart a bit
Do you know what I mean?
Oh, yes, I can see that.
You could move in here, in that retirement home, wouldn't you?
You think you'd like it?
There's plenty of activities, and the staff is very nice.
Especially Anya, she's my favorite.
Oh yes, I met Anya on my way in, she did seem very nice
Maybe I should look into it
I still like having my independence though
And my son Julian still helps out as much as he can
Do you remember Julian?
Of course, I still have my head, you know!
But it must take her some time, to take care of you.
And here, there's everything you need!
You see movies, you participate in games, there's a library...
And meals are pretty good.
But you know me, I'm demanding on the kitchen!
Oh yes, I remember that!
You always were!
What is your favourite meal that they make?
Or should I say that you make them make!
The duck jam with the cranberry jam.
It's hard to cook the duck, especially when you make a lot of people for a lot of people, but here, the cook can do very well!
Oh that does sound good, and quite fancy for a retirement home
I had thought it would all be bowls of watery soup and dry crackers!
And you know how much I like butter and cheese and rich, tasty foods
Yes!
My neighbor Roger only eats bowls of soup, that's true.
But that's because he has no teeth, the poor old.
I've got almost all my teeth, I'm lucky!
Do you want to go to the common room for a cup of tea?
I have always admired your full set of teeth
Especially at our ages!
What a good idea
Let's go have some tea
Beautiful.
Plus, they have good cakes.
And it's free!
I mean, given what it costs me every month, luckily it's free.
As soon as I get up, let's go!
Haha, you crack me up!
Don't put your back out getting out of the chair.
I can give Anya a shout to get the hoist
Oh, yeah, that's a good idea.
It's been 15 minutes since I've seen her, I miss her!
Oh wow you really do like Anya a lot!
I think she might be a bit too young for you
I'm allowed to dream, don't I?
Plus I thought you had secretly always loved me...
It's a secret!
You're not supposed to know!
But I have always known
You have always been there, through my 5 previous failed marriages
You were always there to pick up the pieces
I always thought there would be more time
And that our time together would come when we were still young enough to enjoy it
If you move in here, we could live together!
I always thought the idea of growing old together sounded romantic
But the reality is bit less romantic - it's mostly deafness, forgetfulness, and aches and pains.
But it would be nice to do experience those things with someone else
We could try, my dear!
Here's Anya.
Let's go to tea!
We could get cake!
Lots of it!
Are you going to invite a lot of people?
Well, the thing is, the more people there are, the less cake there’ll be for us!
That's not a very Christian idea!
Unless we ask them to bring some with them.
I know but it’s my party so I decide!
Yeah, you could eat a cake all by yourself in your corner!
Oh no, that’s not very fun!
What do you suggest then?
You have to invite a lot of people and prepare a lot of cake for the party to be good.
By the way, I hope you didn't invite Robert.
Oh... who should invite?
I don’t have many friends except Robert...
Ow!
I'm warning you, it's Robert or me.
Ok ok... then you can do the guest list.
I’ll buy the decorations!
I thought I'd invite Rachel, you know her.
Ok, if you want.
But only if she doesn’t bring her dog with her.
I can’t stand the things!
You know without her dog she won't come
She's been so... weird since she's on the thesis.
Ok but it’ll have to stay outside.
I don’t want it messing up the new carpet!
We'll put it on the balcony, hopefully it'll jump!
That’s horrible!
No more horrible than Rex
Do you not have lots of pets at home?
I thought you did...
I had a Rottweiler, but I had to get rid of it, he ate my neighbor.
So we ate the Rottweiler for my son's birthday
Oh no!
Was he not traumatised?
Rottweiler?
No your son!
No, he asked for it again.
It got me a little bit worried.
Well he could come along tonight and deal with Rex!
Take the basket.
I'll grab the rabbit!
You did say you liked rabbits, didn't you?
I'll take the basket if it's full!
Almost.
But there's still some space for some more berries if you like.
With pleasure, I like berries very much.
More than rabbits!
Oh, probably a good thing I couldn't catch it then.
But we should probably be heading back soon.
It's getting dark.
Yes, it is.
Especially since we don't have a tent to shelter us
And it's getting a little cold.
Do you want a scarf?
I always bring several with me just in case.
And a couple of hats.
Ooh I even have some gloves!
I'm not saying no for the scarf, because I'm really cold.
Besides, I have a big cold, so I'd better cover for myself.
You mean you need to wrap up warm?
I'll warm myself with your scarf!
Here you go!
And I might even have some biscuits...
Wait a sec
No, sorry.
There are none left.
Great.
Ah, too bad.
But I think I see a Thermos in the back of the basket.
Is it full?
Is it hot?
There's hot water in it!
And I had tea bags!
We can make a little tea to warm up!
Ok then!
And we could add some berries to give it some more flavour too!
Sorry to bother you, but it's my first flight ever and I'm a little scared.
Do you mind if we chat a bit during take-off?
No, not at all!
You're leaving for a holiday?
My first ever abroad!
And I've decided to go all by myself to get away from it all.
Do you fly often?
Every week.
My company is bi-located.
You'll see, it's very nice once we're up here.
Do you really think so?
I'm scared looking out of my second-floor window at home!
I've never liked heights, and we're going to be very high up!
The clouds, from above, it's like a sea of cotton.
And the light is absolutely splendid.
Besides, this is the safest way to transport it, as they say.
I can't see the light.
I've got my eyes closed.
I don't like it.
Everything's starting to move!
They'll be stopping by with the drinks soon.
You should ask for a glass of wine.
You wouldn't mind paying for me, would you?
I can't really find my purse with my eyes closed...
I can see your bag.
I'm just gonna take your credit card and pay for both of us and our next-door neighbor if you don't mind.
What's the code for your credit card?
No!
Don't do that!
That's another reason I don't like flying!
You can never trust people in confined spaces!
But why do you talk to me?
I didn't have much choice, did I?
But, whilst you're here, could you go get me a glass of water perhaps?
That would be very nice of you.
And I might just forget what you just said about my credit card.
I'll get the stewardess out here.
She'll bring you a glass of water.
Just relax.
Everything's gonna be okay,
The plane, it's very safe.
And there's always movies to change your mind.
It's been a while since we've been in the air.
We'll be there in five minutes.
You almost finished your first flight!
Thank you so much.
And thank you for the chocolate bar I took out of your bag whilst you weren't looking.
It was absolutely delicious.
Flying isn't so bad!
It was chocolate laxative!
You haven't eaten it, have you?
I think I'm gonna have to switch places...
It's a shame I've got the aisle seat.
You're going to struggle to past!
Maybe I don't like flying after all...
Well.... Good morning, Doctor.
Good morning.
How are you feeling today?
Great--I did it!
I left him!
You finally split up with your friend?
And how are you feeling?
Free?
Relieved?
Maybe a little worried, too?
My 'friend'--hah!
He was my husband, but my friend?
Not for years.
You know, he thought I didn't know what him and Martin were doing when they said they were "playing handball"...
He's young, but that doesn't excuse his selfishness.
And most importantly, this relationship was hurting you.
But you didn't answer me, how do you feel now, after leaving him?
As I said in the beginning: great!
You know, you don't really listen to me any more than he ever did... I think that's why I've always been so attached to you.
Be careful, I'm only your psychiatrist!
Oh, come on... You know that's not true.
I know that
What do you think you know exactly?
I know that's not true.
Frankly, the only he didn't know was HIM, and he would've, if he'd ever listened to me... Why do you think I did this??
Why do you think I left him?
It was so that WE could be together.
Are you going to pretend that you haven't been doing what you've been doing these past three years that I've been in therapy with you?
You're putting me in a difficult position.
I'm your psychiatrist.
When I listen to you and I talk to you, it's for your psychological balance, because it's my job.
Have you just been playing with me all this time?
PRETENDING to want to know how my day was, how I felt about things, what I was looking for in life?
Playing with me... you... you...
It's not a game, that's how therapy happens.
Look, I think you should think about what you want from your psychiatrist.
Maybe you should go to therapy with another psychiatrist.
Because now I feel, in your mind, things are different from what they should be to make this happen.
Hah--I've BEEN seeing another psychiatrist!
You didn't even know it!
You think you're so smart... playing with me all this time... I HATE you...
I think we're going to end this meeting now.
By the way, it's time for my next patient.
Or rather, my next patient, by the way.
Ohlala, I don't recognize this place at all.
What about you?
No not all, it looks very creepy!
Very much so.
Do you have a compass?
We'll look on the map.
No I dont have a compass or a map.
I could try my phone - but there is no reception.
Let's try going back the way we came
I thought you were taking the compass...
Does your phone have one?
It's got GPS, it doesn't need a connection.
I've got the map.
No, you said you were taking the compass.
And the map.
We'll have to hurry, it's getting dark already
Okay.
Too bad.
We'll do as you said and try to retrace our steps.
I've got a flashlight.
That's something...
No, if you have the map we could see if there is a shorter route out of here.
It will take us hours to get back the way we cme, in the dark, and through all that mud ...
Sure, with the rain from this morning, the ground is very muddy.
But without a compass it's hard to know which way to return even with the map.
But since we're from the south, I think we'll get through this...
If we head up the hill to out right, that must be eastards, you can see from the contours on the map.
Then we may be able to see the road or the village from the top.
Once we rach the road it will be easy.
That's a great idea.
Going up on that hill will give us the right visibility and the village will be lit up so we can spot him easily to go in the right direction.
Let's go!
According to the map there should be some rocks, a crag or a small cliff near the top of th hill.
If we fing the rocks we shoyld be in the right place
Is that a "Crag"?
I don't know him.
I'm not sure I want to throw up rocks.
But okay, let's go.
We're gonna make it.
Yes Id say thats a crag.
Unfortunately my typing is rather bad, I meant if we find the rocks not if we fling the rocks.
I agree, throwing rocks around will get us nowhere.
W need to saveour energy for the climb and the long walk down.
Absolutely.
Come on, let's move now, or we'll be here in a few days!
So here we are at the edge of the cliff, and look there's the rod, and the village.
Be careful, these rocks are rather slippery , don't want to fall ... aaaaaaaaaarghghghg
Yes, you're right.
Let's be careful.
But anyway, it's nice we almost got to the village.
You look a little worried, are you ok?
Not so good.
I don't like to fly at all on bad weather like today.
Not so good, no.
I don't like to fly at all on bad weather like today.
It is difficult but you ve listened to all the instructions from the crew so you have done everything you can
Would distraction help?
Instructions from the crew don't help much when you're afraid of flying!
They can't do anything about the turbulence!
I know it is difficult for you as fear and logic don't always go hand in hand
Would you like to play a card game to take your mind off it all
Yes, actually the logic would want us to get in the head that the plane is the safest transport.
I'll play a card game.
That'll keep my mind occupied.
What games do you like?
Poker, pontoon!
Whist?
Or why don't you suggest something
Ah, I'll play poker.
It's the only game I know!
But tell me, you don't seem very stressed.
I ll get my cards out in a minute
I fly quite often and just try not to think about the process too much
I think the main thing is that it is difficult not to be completely in control
It is similar to having an operation
You just have to trust the anaesthetist
Yes, I do.
The upside with an operation is that you sleep during!
Do you travel for your work or a tourist?
After our game maybe we should both have a drink and try to sleep
I ll get the cards now
Maybe we should just sleep, bye for now
Yes, a good glass of champagne will do me great.
Come on, let's start the game.
Emma, please let me worry about it, I want to rest.
You're always resting.
Let's go for a walk and climb that hill over there.
That will give you something to rest for.
I know, I know, and you're not holding up, you're not able to take time to think about it.
Or even think of nothing.
It's very nice, you should try
I can't just lie by the pool.
I've got the French disease of restless legs.
All those French things, always being noticed.
Don't you have a book or crossword puzzles?
I can give you a comic book, I've brought a comic book.
I don't like comics.
I have a suggestion.
If we go for the walk now I will lie quietly by the pool for 30 minutes afterwards.
I won't say a word.
I won't bother you at all.
Are you kidding?
We're gonna walk for an hour and a half and then we won't even have time to get back by the pool.
It's time for drinks.
You're really amazing.
If you want us to walk tomorrow
Yes I was pulling your leg.
I will only stay quiet for 20 minutes.
Do w have a deal?
All right.
And then, I promise, I'll be a nicer vacation companion.
Oh thanks.
I know I'm really amazing.
I'll get the drinks.
What would you like?
I'll have an orange juice.
I'm sorry to be such a party pooper, but I'm really tired.
You deserve to put up with me.
Ok I'll get the orange juices.
Then I promise to leave you alone and we will go fot a shorter walk tomorrow.
Shall we?
I like the pool, but we're not gonna be here all afternoon!
Don't you want to take a little hike?
The mountains are beautiful here!
You have a one track mind.
Oh you mean go out?
Yeah, yeah, we spent three hours at the pool.
I'm getting a little bored, aren't you?
I'm in heaven.
I don't understand how you can be happy about doing nothing for hours.
It's totally incomprehensible to me.
I know.
So you want to stay here again?
They don't call you Einstein for ... No they don't call you Einstein at all.
Do they?
You go.
Take pictures.
Show me later.
No no, I don't want to go alone, it's absurd.
But once again, when you want to do different things, you end up doing whatever you want.
Then we have a dilemma.
It's always like that.
I feel like you don't give a shit about my mind.
It's hard, you know.
Well now I can't relax knowing you're unhappy.
What shall we do?
How about a compromise?
What do you suggest?
We could walk up that mountain and ask the wise man of the woods what he thinks we should do.
Who's the wise man of the woods?
Well he probably doesn't exist but at least we would be up a mountain looking for him instead of having this stupid argument.
Okay.
Let's do this.
Thank you for listening to me for once!
Honey, it's your birthday in exactly two months, we have to throw a party, what do you think?
Wow great idea.
Shall we have it at home?
If you want!
How many people do you think we can invite?
Well I would quite like an intimate gathering, just our close friends.
Okay.
But it's your turn to choose, it's your birthday, after all!
Perhaps we could get some caterers in to do the food?
Sure it's easier.
But you know I like to cook, so I can also do one of the things if you want.
Oh that would be lovely.
Could you make me a fruit cake with icing decorations?
Yes, of course!
What kind of fruit do you prefer?
Sultanas, raisins and dried apricots are my favourites.
All right, I'll do that.
I can make glassworks, too, if you want.
It's convenient for the holidays.
I would like to make it fancy dress too.
We could have a theme like James Bond characters or pirates.
What do you think?
Sure.
I like the idea of James Bond characters.
It makes people look a little bit classy.
I'll be Octopussy!
You want me to be James?
The problem is there may be several James!
Of course, you'll be the best James ever!
I don't look like him...
Well, how about the drinks, what do you suggest?
We could make sangria.
And if the weather is nice we could hold it in the garden.
Yes, that's a good idea!
Sangria, and a punch.
Now all we have to do is make the guest list and send out the invites.
I'll get started on it.
I've got most people in email so that would be the quickest way.
Yeah.
E-mails will do.
This is exactly the vacation I wanted.
A swimming pool, sun and nothing else.
Nothing else?
Really?
Not even a trip into town?
I forgot a good book.
We could do some tourist shopping, or even go sightseeing!
What do you think?
The city, I see the rest of the year!
But the city's the city.
We're abroad!
It's not the same thing.
There'll be new architecture to see, statues, monuments, art galleries.
You know - culture!
Yeah, but it's nice every once in a while to land somewhere and relax.
But we relax the rest of the year.
You spend all day at home sunning in the garden.
I really want to get out a bit.
And those kids keep splashing me!
What are you talking about?
You can go if you want, and you come back for me
They think it's really funny to spray water at me.
I can't read when the pages are wet.
I don't want to tire
I'm not going anywhere!
How about we put wheels on your sunbed and I push you around town on it.
Would that be ok?
It would be like a rickshaw!
And what would I look like?
Get me another pool in town.
You could just lie back in the sun and relax!
And we'd still get to go around town together!
It's not fair.
We always do what you want to do.
We'll go into town tomorrow.
But tomorrow never comes.
Do you promise?
Yes, I promise.
Think about a program.
Now can you put some sunscreen on, please?
On you or me?
Hello Lucien, how are you today?
I'm old, and all my bones ache
Did you talk to the nurses and the nursing home doctor?
Maybe it's possible to offer something to ease your pain?
I would prefer a large glass of wine thank you.
I'm not sure the doctor's okay with it, but you can ask him.
I came with cakes...
Doctor will probably say 'no', so I'll just go aout and buy a bottle of cheap wine and hide it in my locker
Maybe this will cheer you up...
The cakes are a good idea.
We can enjoy them with a glass or two of wine.
If you want to buy a bottle of wine and drink it secretly, buy a nice bottle...!
I also got your favorite jazz CDs.
I still have money left from my birthday, so I'll make sure it's a good wine
come over as soon as you can.
We'll be really naughty, and smoke two of my small cigars as well.
It's not a bad idea...
But how could we not turn off the fire alarm with the smoke...
Remember, the last time, she had declined...
And the nurses were not happy because they thought there was a fire in the establishment...
You will have to keep the wine and cigars a secret from the staff here.
Yes, but with the smoke of the cigar, it's not very discreet...
We will just have to go into the garden with two cigars two glasses and our bottle of wine
I'll also have the cake for this makeshift drink.
Why don't you bring a bottle as well, then we can get drunk, escape and go to a night club
I thought you hurt all over?
You want to go dancing?
Nothing that a few glasses of wine and a visit to a night club wouldn't fix
No offense, but with your walker and your false teeth, I'm not sure you're very popular with young women.
When the young people get drunk, they won't care about my prostheses
That's right.
Your comment WAS offensive.
You're forgetting your hearing aid and thick spectacles.
You're nearly blind
It wasn't offensive but realistic...
But I agree with you...
Me too, with my false teeth and my huge glasses, I'm not very attractive...
The residential home's matron has arrived.
She's taken my wine and cigars.
I'm oof to bed.
Find your own night club
I think I hurt you...
But remember... if we were young and beautiful... we are now old, but without losing our charm...
Including false teeth, scope, and walker...
I'm just irritable tonight, now my wine has been taken.
I'm off to bed.
Good night
Please take a seat.
You can put your coat on the hook over there.
So, what brings you here today?
Doctor, it's been several nights since I've been sleeping
There's something I'm worried about.
But I just can't figure out what
Well, we could try to figure it out together!
Just to be clear, do you mean you're struggling to sleep or that you're sleeping too much?
I'm not sleeping.
I'm trying to figure out what's on my mind.
And if I get to sleep, I have strange dreams.
What happens in these dreams of yours?
Can you think of any possible link to your day-to-day life?
Yes, it is possible.
Or maybe not.
Maybe it's an older thing.
Can you perhaps describe your latest dream?
Yes
I'm in an aquarium
Everything is dark around me
Uh huh... go on.
I move easily between rocks and seaweed
The aquarium is awesome, I can't see the windows
The fish say hello
Some people don't know me
Do you know them?
Do you know the fish too?
Are they familiar to you?
I don't know their names.
Of all sizes
I believe the grandfather of the little mermaid too
You mean that he's there too?
What is he doing in the aquarium?
Yes, he is.
He's cooking eggs on the plate.
That's interesting?
Are there chickens there too?
This could be very interesting.
Chickens?
With eggs?
Or fish eggs - you didn't say what kind they were.
No.
Huge eggs.
Maybe this so you have some fish eggs.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Maybe the eggs are from huge fish.
Don't be.
Don't worry.
It's not your fault you have strange dreams. Perhaps you could draw your dreams.
It might help to understand the emotions behind them, and produce a nice piece of artwork while you're at it!
What the hell is going on?
It's stopped between floors.
I'll press the button to floor two again.
Yeah, make it quick, I have a meeting in 15 minutes.
Is it working?
Ok OK.
I've pressed it but we are still not moving.
Is there an emergency button?
Look, you're in front!
There's really no one else we can count on in this building!
I'm gonna have to complain to the technical service!
It's a scandal!
calm down, shouting won't help.
We need to work out what to do.
Perhaps there is a signal here.
Have yo got you
Have you got your phone with you?
I'm not going to calm down!
I have a conference call with the Tokyo office in less than 15 minutes.
I can't miss it.
The box depends on it.
Your salary depends on it.
Call for help!
There's the big red button!
In the name of God!
Why is it my fault?
If you paid me more I would press more buttons for help
What if I sing you a song to calm you down?
Right, I've pressed the big red button and nothing has happened.
Well, my phone doesn't work in the damn metal box!
You need to get a better phone
No, you're not going to sing!
I hate singers!
My ex-husband was a singer.
He used to sing all the time.
We could never concentrate at home.
Or sleep.
He even sang in his sleep.
I don't know why I'm telling you this.
Get us out of here!
OK OK.
It is moving now and here is floor two.
You will get to your meeting on time, but not with me.
I've had enough of you.
I quit!
Hello Sami, how are you today?
How is your arthritis?
The weather is so good, I hope it's not too bad!
Ah, hello, I'm glad to see you, it's been so long!
Unfortunately, the moisture is playing tricks on me, and my arthritis makes me suffer terribly.
I am so sorry to hear that!
Hopefully it will go away soon
That's sweet, but you know what it's like at my age...
You'll never guess who I ran into at the church sale last Saturday - Simon!
He reminded me of that party we had last year, how lovely it was to sit outside then
Yes, we're all no spring chickens anymore
Dear Simon, how has he been all this time?
Did he finally take the time to sign up for the Amicale?
He seems to be doing well, though you know what happened with his wife last year, he's being very brave
I haven't heard about the plans for the Amicale?!
How unfortunate!
I think he should have been in the dating seminars for retired kids while he's still green.
But maybe you should also sign up for these activities?
Hahaha, I don't need seminars to teach me!
But I'm sorry, I'm going to have to leave you
I must get home in time to prepare lunch or I'll get those fainting spells again
But it's been lovely to see you!
You must come visit me soon
It was good to see you too!
I hope I can come and see you soon.
And I hope you get a respite from the arthritis!
Ugh I'm fed up of nature.
All it does is give me a blocked nose and insect bites.
If you like nature it's hard to escape insect bites.
But why the clogged nose, you're allergic to something: Flowers, trees...?
I don't know.
I appear to be allergic to most things these days.
But nature just seems to keep following me everywhere!
We'd have to do a desensitization test.
Maybe you're allergic to animal hairs, too.
But this doesn't tell us where we are.
Do you have any idea where to go?
No idea whatsoever.
Just get us anywhere it doesn't itch anymore!
We could try to find a pond, but I bet we'd get eaten alive by mosquitos.
No, I don't think we should aim at the pond.
We'd have to get out of the forest quickly.
Why don't we scream?
Or maybe we could just get back to ourselves?
Do you have a loud voice?
Or a megaphone that could help us?
Yes, I could use my beautiful voice.
I didn't think to take my megaphone.
Sorry.
I have a lot of water, though.
Do you have your phone with you?
Let's try Google Maps?
Please let's not.
I'm idealogically opposed to Google and any other institute trying to use us to get more data!
We could just wander aimlessly and hope we find our way back.
I have a vacuum cleaner that uses that very technique to clean the flat!
You want us to straddle by snorting the ground?
No, it's a joke.
We should never have left the roads.
Besides, I think that's what triggers an allergic reaction.
Or these are the six little pistachio macaroons you took from the snack bar.
What?
You saw me take them?
I thought I was being subtle...
No, I saw the whole thing.
Do you know how to direct yourself by the position of the sun?
Not me.
I may still pull out my phone and use Google, but if I've understood this is going to start a new allergy attack.!
Ok, ok.
You can use Google Maps...
This is not good timing!
An elevator failure is never the time!
Let's flip the alarm.
No don’t do that.
I’d actually rather present my pitch directly to you.
Really?
What do you want us to do?
Even if it's a bad time, it better be the elevator that goes down!
Yes.
I was going to suggest that you retired immediately.
Please don’t take this the wrong way.
I'm not taking this the wrong way, but I don't know how to pull out of an elevator down.
You make and design elevators but this one breaks every day.
It’s a disgrace.
Our office is on the four hundredth floor and I have to take the stairs every day.
That.
That's no reason not to flip the alarm!
I just thought you’d like the chance to defend yourself before going before the board of governors.
Is it getting hot in here?
I think you're very aggressive.
Let's try to find a solution.
Or do you want to take advantage of the situation to have a good time together and without aggression?
What sort of good time did you have in mind?
I have always had a thing for people in authority.
Uh... it depends on you...
I’m very open minded.
Open-minded, perhaps, but in a very confined space.
I'd prefer a stubborn spirit in an open space.
An alcoholic spirit?
Perhaps we could get a drink together?
Well, I feel like there's a bar in the elevator.
Oh yes, there is.
Let’s get plastered.
I don't know how we're gonna get out and the elevator and this dialogue that I prefer to end.
Good luck with the meeting.
That's it.
The elevator's down again.
I think you should, as a boss, do something to make these blackouts stop!
I’m afraid there’s very little I can do.
I’ve spoken to the council, but they just blame the weather.
The masters, always the same.
I don't think it's a matter of time.
More money, don't you think?
The system is so antiquated.
It can’t cope with the heat.
It would cost millions.
That's just it.
If the system is old and outdated, it's security issues for your employees, right?
It deserves to spend millions of dollars to protect us.
We are just a small business.
I have very little leverage.
Perhaps you could take a pay cut to help pay?
Oh, my God, you're really something.
It's up to us to pay for the repairs with our salaries!
Amazing.
You should start screaming with me to call 911.
Calm down.
All I’m asking for is half of your salary for the next twenty years.
Otherwise you’ll have to use the stairs.
No problem.
I don't see any drawbacks to use the stairs.
But you're gonna have to do the same, you guys, do the same thing.
You look like you could do with using the stairs a bit more.
I have many lazy employees.
It's possible.
There are also many of our leaders who are fat and skinny on borrowed stairs!
I once won Mr Universe, I’ll have you know.
I’m an adonis.
Modest and proud of it, obviously.
Ah, that's it.
The door opens.
Goodbye, you cheap bastard!
Let's see if they prefer white or brown bread.
Oh you took both?
Great.
I suggest we give this group some white, and brown to this other group.
I heard that the bread was bad for the ducks.
Now we can compare the efficiency of white bread and the black bread on these ducks.
This is gonna be interesting.
Yes, that is a conspiracy spread by firms that produce crackers and biscuits.
They want to feed the ducks with crackers and cookies?
It's stupid, it's too fat and too salty.
And a lot of conservatives.
At least the bread is healthy!
It is empty calories, which makes the ducks fat and more likely to sink.
It could make a lot of fat, though.
Anyway, they seem to like two types of bread.
Yes maybe some kale and broccoli would be better for them.
Here, the little ducklings are coming in single file!
I'm not even sure I know what the ducks are eating.
Early in the season all of the mating pairs still have lots of ducklings.
Yeah, it's kind of cute.
I'm a little disappointed, at the moment they seem to digest the bread perfectly.
The main challenge in feeding ducks lies in throwing the bread to different places so that even the smaller ducks get some too.
Absolutely.
But even among adults there seems to be dominant and dominant.
Look at this one, every time he goes for the piece of bread to steal from his rightful recipient.
Are we allowed to fish here?
There's a fisherman there.
Yes, the more aggressive ducks get more food and are better able to dominate the others.
There are fishermen wading in the river as well but they need to watch out for snapping turtles.
Are there turtles?
I like turtles a lot!
And swans are very aggressive this time of year.
Everyone likes turtles!
I hope so.
I like their little alien heads and their wet skin of old men!
The pigeons also come later and eat the bread crumbs that are dropped on the river bank.
When I was little, I hated my cousin, in the country, who sometimes put turtles on her back.
I thought it was totally mean and free.
And I put them on their feet each time.
And of course the hawks come for the pigeons.
Yeah, it's the food chain.
However, I doubt that the hawks are interested in turtles.
Sometimes they are lucky and get a small dog or cat instead.
That's for the day of the party!
Well, the ducks are still here.
They want more bread.
Is there any left?
Ducks are very patient creatures.
Of course
We throw them all that's left?
There are always some crumbs at the bottom of the bag.
I'm really tired today... so I say we stay by the pool!
Oh come on.
Do you really want to waste the entire holiday here?
We might as well have gone to our local pool.
Oh please can we do something else.
A hike perhaps?
Honestly, I'd rather stay with my mother in peace... you know very well she can't walk that much!
Ok, fine.
We can do something that your mother can do as well then.
How about the beach?
She can read her book under a parasol and we can build sand castles!
Why not, but I'm still enjoying the pool.
Don't you want to do some laps?
Yeah, but it gets boring.
I've already done a couple of hundred laps today.
If I do any more I'm going to start going really barmy.
And I keep bumping into people swimming slowly.
A little drink by the bar perhaps?
Or a lolly?
Maybe later.
I'll watch you do your laps.
But I don't want to do laps.
I want to build sand castles, eat lollies, go on a hike.
Anything but stay by the pool.
What do you usually do on holiday?
I read, I rest, I go out for a drink on the terrace... and you?
I build sand castles eat lollies and go for walks, as I said.
Well, would you prefer to go to the bar to get a drink?
In about an hour?
Or I could get you something if you really want.
I just don't like staying still.
I'll pay if you like.
Ah!
Will you get us some drinks?
Yes, anything to get away from this poolside for five minutes.
What do you want?
I'm pretty sure they have just about everything here.
Get me a coffee, please!
If you want, you can take a ride with the dog, too.
It'll make him feel better, and it'll make him happy.
True.
He looks a bit bored too.
One coffee coming up!
Sugar?
Milk...?
A coffee with sugar, thank you.
Ask my mother to get something for her too!
Ok, one coffee, two vodka shots and a Martini coming up!
I'll be back in a minute.
I'm not sure those ducks will love our old bread
It should soften quite quickly in the water.
Although I do hear bread isn't very good for ducks.
They like peas apparently.
They don't like bread?
What did you bring for them?
Not peas anyway!
I never thought about it.
Peas and green vegetables are better for them.
I think the bread sinks and creates a messy pond - so I hear anyway.
There are signs up saying not to give them bread.
I love coming here though as it's very peaceful.
Watching the ducks is very soothing.
Well, I'm not giving any more bread.
Yes, I also like this pond with the ducks and the swans.
Do you come here often to relax?
I work from home, so it's nice to go out for a few hours otherwise I don't see anyone all day.
What about you?
I come here often to read.
Look at the ducks, pretty girls too... what do you do for work?
I'm a writer.
I'm writing a book about cats at the moment.
What do you do?
On cats?
I love animals, but I'm allergic to polite animals.
Otherwise, I'm a jazz musician.
Yes, I love all kinds of animals too, but as I live in an apartment, it would be cruel to own one as they wouldn't have access to the outdoors.
Ah jazz musician.
What instrument/s do you play?
I play the saxophone.
I think it's an instrument with a wonderful sound.
Sometimes the trumpet.
I have to go, but where do you play?
Maybe I could come along to hear you play.
I hope so.
Give me your e-mail, I'll send you the ad for our next gig.
Help!
Help!
I'm lost in the deep woods, I don't know what happened.
What was the last thing you remember?
How did we end up here?
Don't worry, I've ended up here too.
I was going to pick mushrooms in a corner that I know very well.
I walked away a little bit... and when I turned around, I didn't recognize anything.
And you?
What have you done?
I was smoking by my favourite tree and then all of a sudden I'm here with you.
And my head's a bit funny.
Did you eat any of those mushrooms?
No!
No!
They're poisoned!
I'm making a magic potion, but I'm not telling you what to do!
Well I should hope not.
Nobody tells me what to do.
Although if you're making a magic potion, I have to say that I would be very interested in trying some.
I might even have some ingredients you could add...
Oh, yeah?
Really?
What ingredients?
Because it's a recipe for ancient magic potion with a mystery ingredient...
Well, I'll give you that ingredient... it's...
From the Vache Who Rit!
I'm sorry.
Ok.
I'm not sure I understand what you mean.
It's either the bump on the head I got or you've been eating way too many mushrooms!
What on earth is "the Vache Who Rit?"
A little bit of both.
The Vache Rit!
... Laughing cow in English:
A grilled cheese made in Vosges.
You seem very knowledgeable about it.
And does it have hallucinogenic effects then?
Is that why it's so popular?
Yes, that's exactly what it is!
But there are still many ingredients in this potion.
This morning it's gonna be intense!
We need to start preparing for the wedding!
OK.
Tell me what you'd like me to do first.
What's the menu?
I think you can already start to realize the butterscotch, the pie maker has already prepared the cabbages.
We have a plan:
A puff of vegetables, walnut oil and roquefort.
Then a monkfish with bacon and contacts.
With white wine
That sounds nice.
Are we have canapes?
And dessert.
How many people is it for?
Yes, it'll be for the cocktail.
There's salmon, caviar, and foie gras.
You mean how many guests?
Yes
I think they'll be a hundred and twenty.
Right I'll get going.
I'll see if we've had a delivery of the food.
All right, I'll continue to make dessert at the time.
The fois gras is missing.
Can we substitute it with duck?
What dessert are you making?
No, you don't!
Are you serious?
Oh, my God.
We can actually try to replace it with duck magret, I guess...
Sorry.
I'm trying to do my best.
Oh, don't worry, it's not your fault!
I wonder what could have happened, we may have been misled on the command...
Ouch!
I've cut myself.
I think I need a plaster.
But you cut your finger!
We have to go to the emergency room!
I'm afraid of blood, I'm going to faint
Oh, my God, I don't feel well.
I'm gonna throw up.
The day isn't going so well.
Let's cancel the wedding.
I see you're resourceful.
That's exactly what we're gonna do.
You call the bride and groom?
Fab!
A trip to the beach it is!
Hi, honey, how was your day?
It was so awful I don't know where to start!
Firstly, the car broke down
and it was pouring with rain so I got wet running for the train.
The train was full so I had to stand all the way in to town.
So eventually I arrived late for work.
My boss is not happy.
I don't get it.
You dropped out of our car to catch the train?
And the train being full you went on foot?
I understand you were late for work.
Ah ok.
The car broke down so I had to leave it at the side of the road.
I had to go to work by train.
There were no seats on the train, but I could stand up.
Does that make sense?
Anyway, how was your day?
Well, no, honey, I don't understand what happened to you.
Me, my day has been excellent.
But how did you get home?
You left the car at work?
No, the car is at the garage being mended.
I think it is going to be expensive to fix.
I'm glad you had a good day.
Well, apart from that little transport problem, how are your relations with your boss?
That's still the main problem.
Well he was fine about it once I'd explained what had happened.
I have to make the time up tomorrow, so I'll be late home from work.
We have tickets to go to the theatre tomorrow too!
No!
Your boss invites you to the theater?
I'm not sure I agree.
No, we have tickets darling, but it might mean we are a bit late as I have to work late.
You and I are going to the theatre.
Right.
I'm hungry and it's now too late to cook.
Shall we go out to dinner?
I love the theater.
Which play will be played?
I'm hungry, too, we can go to the restaurant if you want.
Wonderful!
Let's go to dinner and chat more then.
Hi!
So, it's my birthday next week, and I'd like to throw a big party!
Great!
I love parties!
What are you planning on doing?
A big one or just a couple of friends?
I'm not sure, but a big party with all my friends.
At my place it's not big enough, can I rent a room or book a bar?
You could, although you'll have to hurry before it's too late.
I'll help you if you like.
Thank you very much!
It's probably too late to rent a room then.
Do you know a nice bar nearby, and mostly big enough?
Yeah sure.
There's The King's Head.
It's more of a pub than a bar, but you should be able to book a space.
And the bartender's an idiot, so you could always hire him as a jester!
Only kidding... but they do allow you to bring your own entertainment if you want.
Thank you, that's great advice!
I just called them, they said yes!
So we have the back room, it's big enough, starting from 7: 00.
So that's your alcohol sorted.
What do you think about the entertainment idea?
I know a man who knows a man who knows a busker, who might be able to come along and play a bit of guitar.
I'd like to bring strippers in... do you think the bartender would accept?
Ha ha ha!
Seriously, you're right about the musicians.
I have a friend who's in a music group, so I'm going to ask him to come out and play a little!
Great!
Are they any good?
I can't think of anything worse than a rubbish band playing all night.
No offense to your friend...
Uh, they just started out, actually, they're a little beginner...
Actually it's an experimental group, they combine a lot of music styles!
They play the accordion, the banjo, the drum and the recorder!
Do you think it might spoil the evening?
Nah, should be alright.
I'm a massive fan of the banjo, so it should be a blast!
I'm really looking forward to it now!
Thank God!
Now all we have to do is send out the invitations.
You'll be the first to receive the invitation, of course.
Great!
I'm gonna go and buy a brand new dress to wear!
We absolutely need to go shopping!
Excuse me, are you all right?
No, I'm not.
I'm on an aeroplane and I am very scared.
Is this the first time you've been on a plane?
No.
I'm a frequent flyer.
What about you?
I take the plane too often.
But you're still afraid of flying, though you're a regular?
That's surprising!
Did you have a bad experience?
The person next to me was sick all over me and you yourself look rather ill.
Oh, no, I'm fine, thank you.
I have a rather pale complexion, that's all.
You're the one who seems to be really stressed.
Don't worry, everything's going to be fine.
Are you sure?
You look more green than pale.
Really?
If you're right, I hope it's nothing serious.
Yes.
But maybe it's the lighting in here.
But if I start having problems of digestion, I have a simple solution:
I'm also afraid of flight.
It's not natural.
Can I hold your hand please?
Mind you, whiskey is perfect for stress, too.
Uh... if you want.
If I have any more alcohol I may be sick on you.
Would you like a whiskey?
No thank you.
Just the hand please.
All right.
But I'm gonna get a whiskey, though.
Now we've taken off, I'm going to get off.
All the best.
Oh, God, they only have Jack Daniels.
Why don't they have Scottish whiskey?
It's not the same thing!
Oh yes, we've finally landed.
All right, good day to you.
Have a safe onward journey
For tonight's meal, we're waiting for 10 people...
I suggest we see to think together on the menu.
Do you mean there are ten customers or are they late?
There will be ten clients, who booked for tonight, at twenty o'clock.
Oh I understand now!
What shall we cook?
That's the question.
I understand there was a movie star...
Are any of them vegetarian or even vegan?
Then we must not disappoint them.
Which movie star is coming?
Do you think I could get them to autograph a napkin?
Tom Hanks.
I hear he's very nice.
Maybe we can get an autograph at the end.
I think my favourite film was Forrest Gump.
And I don't think he's a vegetarian.
Well when he was on that island in Castaway he must have eaten meat!
We could schedule a carpaccio of saint chatter in the entrance.
What do you mean?
We're just going to get the scallops.
We'll get the edible part, and cut it into thin slices.
Perhaps we could use them as a starter and then do a meat dish.
Then marinate in lemon juice.
I think it can make a nice entrance.
Yeah, it's a good idea to put on a meat plate!
You got any ideas?
What about roast breast of pigeon with beetroot, dauphine potatoes and a blackberry jus?
You mean blackberries?
Or a blackberry pie to finish?
I mean a blackberry sauce to go with the pigeon.
It's a good idea, original, which will probably enjoy our living.
What about dessert?
Maybe we could make a lemon pie?
Or chocolate macaroons?
I'm glad you like my ideas.
I got them from watching Masterchef on television.
Really?
I like lemon pie.
Perhaps with Chantilly cream?
I watch that show, too!
It's good to see you.
It's been a long time and since I don't have a lot of visitors.
Good to see you too !
Sorry I haven’t visited in so long.
I’ve just come back from my holiday
Are you coming back from vacation?
All right.
Where did you go this year?
I have a few walks around the nursing home.
Yes, I have just returned from my honeymoon in Hawaii
That’s great , have you made any friends here yet?
Hawaii?
Fabulous!
What have you done?
Sea-fishing, boat walks...?
If not, yes, I made a few friends here with whom I speak music, literature, not to forget chess parts!
We explored the volcanoes on the island , lay on the beach and enjoyed the glorious sunsets.
I'd like to visit Hawaii.
And where are you going to live now?
Do you still have your math teacher position?
I’m thinking to live in Hawaii for the rest of my life it was a life - changing experience.
I was really moved by the hula dancing, and have become pretty good at it.
For now I am living with my brother , I want to quit math teaching and dance full time
Going from teaching of mathematics to dance is original!
But you told me you went on a honeymoon!
What does your husband do?
Yes my honeymoon has changed my life
He’s a scuba diver camera man .
So He would also love to move there
It was lovely seeing you again
I have to meet another friend On the first floor now
Have a lovely rest of your evening
Hey, how was your day?
Hey, I had a terrible day at the office.
Tell me.
What happened?
I accidentally transferred â¬1 billion to the wrong customer account!
My boss was so angry with me.
She told me that if we cannot get the money back then I'll need to find the 1 billion euros myself.
Isn't there another way?
No way!
I don't know.
If we cannot get the money back, can you give me 1 billion euros to pay back to the company?
But we don't have it!
Isn't it possible to get a lawyer?
Yes, I think you're right.
We should get a lawyer and explain that this was a mistake.
But if the lawyer can't help us then maybe we should ask a sorcerer to help us to cast a spell on my boss.
Do you know any good sorcerers?
Not in particular.
But we'll probably find some in the forest
I don't like going into the woods.
Could you go for me and find the best sorcerer for less than 1 billion euros?
Are you stupid?
Pay even more?
What if it doesn't work?
I said for less than 1 billion euros not more than 1 billion euros.
Where will I get a billion euros?
My parents won't lend me that kind of money.
OK then we will need to steal the money from the bank.
I'm going to bed.
We'll think about it tomorrow.
OK, I'm sorry for all the stress that my awful day has caused.
So Ali how are you settling in at the company?
I'm very happy to join the group.
It's a great opportunity for me.
How are you today?
I’m very fed up about being stuck in this lift!
I have a very important meeting to attend.
What are you supposed to be doing??
Have you found any new plans for our program?
Yes, I think we should press the emergency call button.
But, I don't think it's working right now.
No I am thinking of ditching it.
I have some plans of my own.
Maybe we should knock on doors and make noise?
What do you think?
Absolutely!
Great idea!
Let’s stamp our feet and shout loudly.
I hear noise.
I think the co-workers called 911.
In the meantime, we could talk about our future plans.
What do you think?
Thank goodness for that!
Where will you go when we finally get out of here?
I have precisely the plans I have to show you tomorrow.
Do you wish to see them?
After the elevator, I have to go to my office to print new cards.
What about you, boss?
I have my very important meeting to attend if they can rescue us soon!
I hear people outside!
Yes, deliverance should be here any minute.
Who are you receiving?
What do you mean?
This afternoon, who do you have an appointment with?
I am meetin with the chairman.
I think he wants to talk about my promotion.
Great!
Good date.
We're blocked.
And I was supposed to go to an important meeting!
At least that means that somebody might wonder where you are and come looking
This liftoften breaks and the alarm bell does not work
Hopefully, we'll soon find out there's something unusual going on.
And yourself, what department do you work for?
I work in the trading department, mostly for crude oil
Ocassionally we will trade products too
You make the market for what kind of oil.
And why do you want to exchange our products?
You have to sell them instead!
I meant crude oil products, gasoline, lpg
Also when we have surplus we will sell to someone else directly or exchange for a more timely delivery
It is a strange business
I am started GN to get claustrophobic
Sorry I am starting to get claustrophobic
It's normal to have a little stress in a volume as small as the elevator.
Take a deep breath and you'll feel better.
The paramedics will be here any minute.
I hope so, it is getting worse
I was stuck in a lift for four hours when I was a child
Oh, yes, I understand.
Childhood memories always remain in memory, especially if they're unpleasant!
I am starting to sweat as I remember
I hope they won't be long finding us
Last time I was on my own
My parents just thought I had gone off in a strop
Living this kind of experience alone, especially child, is not very pleasant.
But I hear noises.
Courage, help is coming!
Thank goodness.
Hey, Caroline, don't you get bored a bit here?
I'm ok actually.
I'm just enjoying the beautiful weather and the calm breeze.
What else could you ask for?
I'd like to go for a walk for a change.
But aren't you tired?
We had a huge lunch...
Exactly, the boardwalk's good for the digestion!
I find that sleeping can be quite efficient too!
Why are you so keen to go for a walk?
Doing laps in a small pool, that's not very original.
While there's a little forest road right next to it.
I wouldn't mind if you brought me back something cool to drink.
But I quite like being here thanks.
It's too shady in the forest for my liking.
Then I'll leave you and I'll meet you at the end of the afternoon.
Hi!
Wait!
Will you get me something from the shop round the corner?
Pretty please!
Oh, hello, Leontine, how are you?
You look well!
Hello Alice.
Thank you for coming to see me.
I am doing well other than my sore back.
Please, it's always nice to see you, you know.
Bad back!
I read that it's bad for the century, but I wish it didn't last a century!
That's very kind.
How was your journey?
No sweat.
Are you still okay here?
I hope it settles soon as it keeps me awake sometimes.
I am quite happy here and the staff are friendly but Sometimes I don't like the food.
I understand your back and I'm sorry!
I hope it calms down quickly.
The staff seems very pleasant indeed.
I saw your brother yesterday!
AS long as I keep moving it should get better.Thank you.
Oh where did you see my brother?
We met on the street, it was fun!
He was talking to a friend while walking his dog.
Did he give you any messages for me?
He asked me to say hello and tell you he'll be by Tuesday if he can.
That's good news .
I really look forward to his visits.
How far do you live from him?
Yes.
He must have been near his friend's house.
I didn't ask him for details, you know how your brother likes to be discreet about his life.
THe last he came to visit he brought me some delicious chocolates.
I am looking forward to hearing about his trip to France.
Good evening.
What would you like?
I'll have a caipirinha.
With a few olives and sausage rings if possible.
Certainly, sir.
One caipirinha coming up.
Here you are, and your olives, but I'm sorry we don't have any sausage rings.
You don't have a sausage?
It's okay.
I'm surprised you know the caipirinha.
This is not a very common aperitif in Europe.
Where did you learn to do that?
I have been a bartender for a few years and I've worked in a lot of different places.
I also did some training while working in a famous bar in London.
Awesome!
It's a hell of a experience.
Which country did you go to?
What's your favorite aperitif?
I've spent time in France, Germany and South America.
I don't have a favourite aperitif myself - I don't drink much at all, really only at special occasions where I like a glass of champagne.
Yes, a glass of champagne is always, everywhere, an excellent aperitif.
You've traveled a lot!
Which country did you enjoy the most?
South America was really interesting, different from home.
I did some travelling and there was so much to see.
Yes, a lot to see in South America.
Have you been able to go to Argentina, or see the ruins?
Which ruins?
There were a few.
I hope you still could have gone to Machu Picchu.
You bring back memories of these South American countries?
So you've been there yourself?
I sure.
And in Mexico City.
I brought in some very beautiful stones.
Are you interested in mineralogy?
I've met some gold-diggers in my time, but other than that, it's not something I know anything about.
Good evening.
So how was your day?
My day SUCKED.
How was yours?
Mine was fine.
As scheduled.
But you had a difficult meeting in perspective...
The main problem was that I couldn't find a place to eat.
I was starved, and you know how "hangry" I get... I walked around for, like, an hour.
One place after the other was closed, closed, CLOSED.
But, tell me about your day.
Being a little hangry is not like starving to death in Syria... We have to be aware of what the REAL problems are--and aren't.
You mean after your meeting, you tried to isolate yourself to eat but couldn't find a quiet room?
Bad luck.
I know when you need calm, you really need to calm down!
True, true.
How was YOUR day?
My day has been quiet.
A good productive meeting this morning and this afternoon I was able to finish my report.
Have you managed to calm down for lunch?
Other than that, my day was actually pretty good... I spent most of the day writing something that I wanted to work on.
Ah.
That's good.
And what did you write about?
Lunch was fine.
I had a bowl of chirashi--yum!
I wrote about ... hm, what did I write about--I'm getting too old to remember ANYTHING... I wrote about the kinds of information that needs to be recorded in order to repeat and to interpret an experiment.
How about you--what was your meeting about, and what was your report about?
Who was at the meeting, and did everyone behave themselves?
What's a bowl of chirashi-yum?
I've never had it.
The meeting was pretty good.
There must be some trouble.
It's a bit heavy to wear.
But we made it.
That's good.
Anything interesting on the news?
No more than that.
You know that takes time these things.
What about your side?
The usual criminals in the White House.
Trump being an asshole.
Trump being an idiot.
Same ol', same ol'.
OK, I must run out to the store and pick up some coffee.
I'll be back soon--do you want me to pick up anything?
But who's an asshole?
The president of the Us?
Yes--by definition.
You should read the book "Assholes: A Theory." It's a philosopher's take on what, exactly, an asshole is, and why they are as they are, and why they so infuriate us.
It was written in 2010--in other words, long before the current hell--and he talks about Trump at some length!
OK, I'm outta here.
Back in a bit.
Why do we learn about History?
But mademoiselle, history is a very important discipline.
It allows you to understand the present and prepare the future as a student of the past.
And then it's part of the general culture of all educated people.
Not knowing the story is come from nowhere and be lost in the present.
Why does school not teach us more about the negatives of debt and looking after our mental health?
Every teacher specializes in discipline.
I agree with you that certain subjects are not treated enough.
But the story is very important.
It's also in the story that we understand what democracy is, politics, the cultural identity of his country.
And it doesn't fascinate you, ancient civilizations?
The birth of writing?
Yes I suppose it is very interesting, but it does not feel very relevant to the present
Yes, it is, because the story often repeats itself.
Studying the consequences of decisions that were taken in the past allows you to understand what the right decisions to make today!
Let's take an example.
After the first world war, the winners have decided to ask for some very high repairs in Germany.
It meant a fortune.
It ruined the German economy, and drove indirectly into World War II.
After the second world war, the winners understood because of what it was that we didn't have to make the same mistake again.
And they built Europe instead.
And now we've lived in peace for 70 years in Europe.
That is true.
Do you think that one day in the future children will not need to learn to write with a pen and just use a computer instead?
I don't think so.
You'll always have to be able to write letters, sign documents...
But what are you interested in?
What are the subjects that seem useful to you?
I am very passionate about looking after the planet
And making sure that we look after it
by recycling, being mindful of the ocean and finding new sources of energy
Yes, they're very important subjects, you're right.
Are you planning to study in this field?
I would like to study more about the planet and how we can change our behaviour for the better
But I also really enjoy reading and theatre
You might want to start looking into which schools there are cursus that might interest you.
But the environment is a very exciting and very important discipline for our future, so I encourage you in this path!
Do I need a University Degree to get a job working to change the environment?
Depends on what you want to do.
We don't need a college degree to change his behavior daily, and to encourage people to do the same.
But if you want to go further, for example in research or engineering, then you'll need skills and degrees that only higher studies can give you.
If we all used computers at school it would be better for the planet!
How about iPads instead of paper note books?
I think my fellow students would be very happy
You should look into it, because producing computers and iPads are very polluted.
While paper can be produced in a way-in-the-way environment, replanting the trees.
Why is producing computers and iPads very polluting?
Because today, we don't know how to produce them without polluting.
Electronic devices contain many toxic chemicals, for example, in the batteries, the monitors, the chips.
I think about the semi-drivers, who are almost exclusively products in China, in very polluted mines.
But you can talk to your physics teacher, if you're interested.
I have to leave now, because the next class starts in one minute!
See you next week!
Thank you!
Could you please wash your hands after touching your face
It is vital that we maintain good hygiene
You're right.
I'll wash my hands right now!
What do you want us to do next for tonight's menu?
Great, I am pleased we have cleared the ground rules
What is on the menu for tonight, do you remember?
It seems to me that we should be planning an entrance with fish.
Then a dish with meat, and then dessert with red fruit.
Your are very good at inventing special dishes with fresh produce
What shall we do with the bream?
It is lovely and fresh, something simple I suggest that won't detract from the flavour
What exactly do you mean, "Bram," I'm not sure I understand.
Bream is a small white fish, slightly like sea bass I guess
Thank you for your precision.
Maybe we can marinate it in lemon, and with a little olive oil?
In order to serve him in the entrance, along with some fresh vegetables?
I think if you fillet it, then fry it lightly and serve with a lemon and olive oil emulsion
I think we could just prepare it and serve with a little seaweed as it is a starter
Oh, yeah, that's a great idea!
The algae will bring a small side, and it's original!
There are plenty of fresh strawberries, perhaps you could start by mascerating them in sugar and some liqueur
If you get those started
Of course.
What do you think of the healthy eating initiative that the Government are getting involved in?
Maybe we could make a little lemon pie with the strawberries?
Obesity in France is not such a problem as it is in England
Do you think I am right about that?
The object became a global problem.
But with good stuff, you can make you want to eat better.
Bearing that in mind I think we should leave the lemon pies and concentrate on a lighter menu
You're right.
Thanks for your suggestions today, good bye
Excuse me.
I'm trying to have a relaxing time here and I'd prefer not to be disturbed.
Thank you.
Okay.
But it's already over an hour ago that we're here.
We could go to town for a while.
I've seen the town and I'm not impressed.
I'd much rather just laze here in the sun and perhaps read a chapter or two of my book.
I'm really getting into the story and I think it's going to become quite exciting soon.
Okay, suit yourself.
What is this exciting book you're reading?
A detective novel?
It's a kind of detective novel.
The main character is a genealogist and he is trying to make sense of a family story about smugglers and a cache of gold sovereigns.
That sounds like a curious story to me.
I'm gonna go get my science fiction book.
That's better.
Would you like a drink?
Gosh!
I thought you weren't going to ask.
I'd love an Aperol spritz.
Just as a matter of interest; why is a science fiction book better?
I find many of then just too far fetched to be believable.
I suppose it takes all sorts to make the world!
Because the history of the first men who come to Mars and find traces of a very old civilisation, it's much more interesting than your history of genealogist and treasure!
As I said; it takes all sorts.
My book is partly based on fact.
It imagines things that might have happened to a real smuggling gang and incorporates some recent discoveries of a couple of walled-up skeletons.
As far as I understand it, there is very little likelihood of an old civilisation occurring on Mars - at least not a form of life we'd recognise - there's a poor atmosphere and little water.
The probability of finding ruins on Mars is indeed small.
I'll give you that.
That says I don't hate crime novels.
Agatha Christie's for example.
Have you read it?
I have read some of Agatha Christie's novels.
I'm not a great fan because they are rather formulaic.
What I do find fascinating about her is the question of what she did when she disappeared and some people thought that she had committed suicide.
Well, I'll give you 15 more minutes with your genealogist.
Then we'll go to lunch.
Good morning!
You've seen all those ducks!
I see you feed them, too... what is it?
They're mallards and coots.
They really like eating frozen peas
But you defrost them before, right?
Do they like other things?
Yes, it's better to defrost them first.
I think they like vegetation, but I'm not too sure what else
Do you know if there is a cafe close by to here?
Wait...
But it's not close and I don't know if it's open on Sunday.
We have to go a little longer along the pond and then roll up the river for a hundred yards.
Then there's this round-point and you won't be able to miss it.
I recommend the fish and chips.
Even though I think their peas are frozen as well!
Ah, okay.
Do you know what it's called.
Haha!
I like fish and chips - it's a very English dish!
Duck with orange sauce is a favourite of mine too.
What's your favourite dish?
I think it's called "The King of the pond," but I'm not sure.
I like fish and chips a lot, but I don't eat much meat.
I prefer vegetables and fish / shellfish.
Ducks - I prefer them in the pond than on my plate!
So you're a pescatorian?
Ah ah ah... in a way yes!
But now that I think about it, I think that coffee makes orange duck as well.
I don't know if it's any good, you should try it!
Okay I will.
Are you a good cook?
All this talk of food is making me hungry
Yes, I understand!
See you!
Good evening!
What do you have on the pressure?
On the pressure?
i don't follow.
I am pretty stressed out with work at the moment.
is that what you mean?
No, I just wanted to ask what the beers you have on the shooter.
If you have wine, I'll be fine, too.
oh!
sorry!
we have some craft beer from West Virginia that's is quite bitter but very refreshing
i wouldn't recommend the wine because we only have cask wine and it is failry awful
after all, we are beer specialists
Perfect!
I like a lot of bitter beer.
Could you pour me a pint?
if you like a lot of bitter beer, may i suggest going for the full stein of Löwenbrau.
a whole litre of a very drinkable beer
granted, some may see it as being a rather comercial beer, but it is still a solid choice
Then I'll have a whole liter!
Thank you!
What do you have to eat?
remember, drink responsibly.
to eat?
let me see
you're going to need something hearty to soak up all that beer
it looks like you going to be having quite a big night tonight
I'm still in charge!
I'll take a cab.
how about our burger platter.
sound good?
Perfect!
a selection of 30 miniature burgers, each with it's own unique cheese and meat combo
But I don't like onions.
Do you have a burger without onions?
I don't want to be difficult.
we can do all of our burgers without onions if you prefer
30 burger platter, hold the onions.
i'll put the order through
as we say, the customer is always right.
Put on a lot of cheese, especially!
I'm gonna need a lot of beer to pass all those burgers.
Bring me another one soon.
Good morning, Doctor.
Good morning.
Now, tell me.
What's been going on?
I need to talk to you.
Can I sit in this chair?
No, that's mine.
But you can sit anywhere else.
Or if you prefer, you can lie down there.
Some people prefer that.
Can I lie on this couch?
Are you sure?
I don't want to bother, he looks clean and new, I'm kind of worried about sitting on it.
I don't want to ruin it.
I think it would make me feel better to stand.
Would you like me to take my shoes off?
Notice how bad my feet feel, I don't know too much what would be best.
Calm down, please.
Please don't worry.
Aren't you hot?
Please just make yourself at home.
But there's no need to panic.
So, if you're feeling comfortable, what's been going on?
I think my neighbors think I want to hurt them.
So I'm afraid to stay at home and try to make the least noise.
But it's tiring.
I don't belong anywhere, you know.
I'm sure there's somewhere you fit in.
Have you always felt like this?
I don't know.
But I think it's getting harder for me in time.
Plus, my new neighbors are weird.
They always look at me with a strange look.
I think they're listening to what I'm doing through the walls.
Do you listen to them through the walls too?
Oh, no, I'd be too afraid if they found out I was listening.
But I still hear them.
The walls aren't that thick.
That's why I feel like I'm watching.
But I don't have the money to move into a house.
Oh, so you live in a flat at the moment?
Yes, I did, didn't I tell you earlier?
I'm sorry.
Maybe you did.
No worries.
But you never had problems with the old neighbours then?
She was an old person who didn't hear anything and make no noise.
I didn't feel at home.
Well, that will give us a good basis to start with next time.
I'm afraid our time is up for today.
I've got lots of other patients to see.
And a blind date this lunchtime!
Please sign out at reception when you leave.
Okay, thanks for your time, I'm sorry I bothered you.
And I'm sorry I'm always sorry...
I'm sorry.
Good morning, ma'am.
I'm having a hard time understanding the odds.
It's too complicated for me that's done only literature so far!
Help me, please!
Well, I am an English teacher, so I'm not sure I'll be much help...
Do you not like Mr Jameson?
He's your maths teacher, right?
I would understand - he can sometimes come across as a bit intimidating.
Start by telling me what you understand.
I know you're an English teacher, but Mr. Jameson is a bully!
All he does is put us down, and remind us that he's intellectually superior.
I can't take it anymore, and I'm not the only one.
Besides, he keeps harassing my friends.
Oh dear.
Maybe we need to have a proper discussion about that at some point.
Have you contacted anybody about that?
There is a school counsellor on site every Tuesday.
That's the thing.
They're plotting together in order not to let any of the information escape.
Just talking to you puts me in grave danger.
I really didn't know it was this serious.
Don't worry, we'll do something about it.
And never be too scared to talk out about it.
How long has it been going on?
It's been going on since we dared to tell him his course was going too fast.
He's got too much ego and can't stand a contradiction.
Since he's friends with the councilman, he's getting revenge.
However, now that he's aware of his power, he also goes after my friends because they're girls.
Now they hate me because they think it's my fault.
Oh dear.
This really does sound serious.
I'm going to have to organise a meeting to discuss this.
This needs to be sorted out quickly.
I'll talk to the head and see what we can do to investigate, and I'll let you know.
And don't worry, I'll do it quickly!
Thank you so much!
I hope he can rot in jail for the rest of his life, eaten by rats.
So Germaine, how are you today?
So, so, but much better than yesterday, thank you.
How are you?
How are those lovely grandchildren of yours?
Three is it now or am I miscounting!
Oh, good!
It's just all these little pains, it doesn't make life easy!
My grandkids are fine, the last one, Marion's daughter my second daughter, you know, just made her first steps!
As a parent you're not supposed to have favourites, but Marion has been such a lovely daughter.
I'm guessing her child is just as beautiful as she is.
Did you bring in any photographs?
Pains, don't talk to me about pains.
I can barely walk these days
Ah, how I understand you!
It's true that Marion was always the little girl of everyone... kind of like your Oliver, wasn't she?
I don't have any pictures with me, you know, the technology and I... my kids gave me a tablet, but I don't know what to do with it!
For your arthritis, fortunately, you're here, right?
The staff seems very caring.
Oliver gave me a tablet my birthday.
I use it for watching TV and reading books.
He showed me how it works, but if I get stuck the girls in here will always help me.
They are very kind.
Ah, you must be cleverer than me then!
My children often show me how to turn it on and even how to write e-mails, but...
With my poor head, it's too difficult!
Young people go so fast!
Everything has to go fast for them...
Oliver spent ages showing how to switch it on, charge it up, how to send emails.
Watching YouTube, listening to the radio, they're easy.
I have to get someone to download the books for me.
You should really try it - you can set the font size so it's much easier for our old eyes to read the print.
Well, if you say so, I'll hold on!
Still, we live in crazy, crazy times!
It's all happening so fast!
At last!
My dear Germaine, I'm going to have to leave you, I have an appointment at the rheumatologist at 3: 00!
By the time we get there... as always, it's been a pleasure to see you.
Good luck and do come and visit me again soon.
Next time, though, bring those photographs, oh, and if you can carry them some grapes, a box of milk chocolates and the Sunday newspapers.
Love to the family x
go on, tell me what happened.
why do you look so down in the dumps?
I was fine until you saw your head.
I can't stand you anymore
wow.
i was not expecting that.
what did I do?
You've seen how you talk to me you're not even able to say good night.
I demand consideration and mutual respect in a marriage.
With you it's always a one-way street, you get on my nerves and I realize I'll be way better away from you.
how long have you been feeling like this?
Why do get the impression this is the first time you've mentioned anything going wrong between us?
I'm like Louis Jouvet in the children of Heaven, when he tells Arletty he needs a change of air.
You remember that beautiful Marcel Carborn, we saw it in French.
i have no idea what you're talking about.
But, i'm going to go with you on this one and assume that it has just slipped my mind.
so, yeah, sure, i remember your stupid film.
it probably sucked.
and that's why I can't remember it.
i never liked french movies anyway.
they're so introspective and boring
bunch of self-centred navel gazers
The exact term Atmosphera, not Air, but it's the same, I asphyxiation on your side.
You're primitive, stupid, unable to grow up.
At your age, living in a world of Manga and cartoons and pathetic.
I need intellectual stimulation, emotional stimulation, not to live next to a retarded and pimply-faced geek who thinks only of his video games and its Manga.
I did a typo: At your age living in a world of Manga and cartoons are pathetic.
well look at you, Mr Fancy pants!
thinking he's all that with a cherry on top.
how about you get off your intellectual high-horse and get back to rality for a bit
it's thanks to my manga business that i can pay for your stupid art classes where you go off for days on end to your bloody art fairs
the only people buy your crappy paintings is because they feel pity for you
just like your mother did when she bought your first "portrait"...
if that's what you can even call it
that 'ecce homo' fiasco was better than anything you could ever do
typo: the only reason people buy your crappy paintings is because they feel pity for you
Of course, your high-level sexual deviations and your inability to have a satisfying erectile function that you feel obligated to be unpleasant, mean and humiliating.
I need a real man who can take care of his partner, not half impotent sick who's going to be satisfied with pictures of comic books.
You're already handicapped by the dimension.
And don't add to it, either appearing intellectually as well as with your miserable instrument.
look who's talking, Mr 6 centimetres of disappointment! 'real man', honestly.
you make me sick
i tried to hear you out, but you just came at me.
I'm through with you.
enjoy life.
Hello!
It's Julie!
I was calling you about my birthday.
You know, Saturday's Saturday party, you offered to help me with the organization.
Actually, I'd like that.
It's turning into a hell of a party!
Great!
What time do you want me to come over?
Well, if we could have a date two hours before, it wouldn't be bad.
We're gonna have to finish the glassware and pull the silverware and the plates.
And the drinks, too.
Either inside, or in the garden, depends on time.
It could depend a bit on the weather.
Do you know what the forecast is?
Shall I bring those lovely balloons with me, and a few party poppers?
Balloons, yes, why not!
Weather changes every day, it's hard to predict... Sinon, so I also ordered a barrel of beer so I could get some pressure.
People always like that.
But I could really use some help wearing it and set it up...
Have you been drinking already?
A barrel of beer would be great.
There are a few sailors coming along and they love barrelled beer!
Shall I bring some red or white wine?
Or both?
Both!
If there are sailors, there's gonna be a wide range on the drinks.
Do you think we're gonna need rum?
Rum is a must for sailors.
We don't want to upset them and cause a mutiny.
I love sailors...
No!
But we're gonna have to blackmail them.
Are they in the merchant navy, or are there some pirates?
Pirates are the best, especially the rum!
I love sailors too.
We could blackmail them into singing sea shanties!
There's one I know with lots of tattoos, a patch on his eye, and a parrot on his shoulder.
Maybe he is a pirate?
And we'll dance!
In fact, it gives me a lot of ideas about decorating and costumes!
You'll have to introduce me.
He has a parrot?
I prefer parrots with tattoos.
Well, I'm gonna take a look at the decorations and call you back before the party.
Thanks for your help!
And if you ever get any ideas, don't hesitate to call me back.
I gotta go!
Are you okay, honey?
You don't look like you're in a good mood.
You would not believe the day I've had.
I never want to go back to work again!
Everything that could go wrong went wrong.
I mean I even got my hair stuck in the photocopier!
Oh, you poor thing.
What happened to you?
Somebody came to rescue me, thankfully.
But just...just everything seemed to go wrong today...
I even managed to spill coffee over my boss.
Who wasn't very happy.
I mean it wasn't really my fault...
Ouch!
This is the kind of day we would've preferred not to get up in the morning.
Would a little massage do you good?
Or a good beer?
Ah yes please!
For the massage, not for the beer.
Though I wouldn't mind some of the good rum.
Okay for a massage and a rum.
And what did your boss say?
He was mad at you?
After he'd finished flapping his arms around, he did say something not particularly nice - something about his new shirt.
Well he couldn't really have fired for me that.
But he did have a bit of a go - and in front of the entire office!
It's okay, with everything he wins, he'll buy another one!
And then it can happen to anyone!
Anyway, your boss has always been fond of you.
Really?
Isn't that a bit weird?
I mean he's twice my age.
And that would be a bit inappropriate...
Maybe that's why Pauline doesn't like me...
Why do you think she doesn't love you?
Aren't you a little paranoid?
Allow me to point out that you are in your fifth whiskey.
Is that all!
I've have another double please.
Could I also look at the food menu, as perhaps I should eat something?
Yes, eating something with mineral water is a good idea.
Here's the menu.
Let me try a malt whiskey this time with an ice cube.
Now, what shall I eat?
Can I have a sirloin steak with french fries and a side salad?
Sorry, we don't serve this dish till noon.
And I suggest you only take the ice cube without the whiskey.
Why, have you run out of whiskey?
I'll have a bottle of beaujolais instead then.
Can you serve peanuts before noon, as I'm feeling a bit peckish?
I suggest you take a break from alcohol.
Really!
It's not even noon yet and I haven't even started.
I might have to take my custom elsewhere is you're not happy to serve me.
I repeat, you've already taken four whiskeys.
Are you going to take the wheel on your way out?
I won't be leaving you a very good review on Tripadvisor.
You call yourself a bar but won't serve me.
Discriminating against alcoholics!
I'm not allowed to serve drunk clients.
I'm not drunk, I'm still standing!
But your words are inconsistent, and I can't figure out if it's in effect from the slip of the Diabla translation, or a reflection of your mental state.
Haha!
I'm fine, it must be the Diabla, so I'll have another whiskey please!
You're still up, but I suggest you go to bed.
That will be my last word.
The bar round the corner will serve me without a problem. They'll be glad of my custom.
Good morning, Doctor.
This is the first time I've been seeing a little nervous.
So, how has your week been?
I'm having trouble at work.
Well, you have a very challenging job being a librarian.
What exactly has happened?
I feel like the staff aren't too many of them.
I run around all day, following orders from my boss,
Last time I felt like I had a panic attack, I locked myself in the bathroom to cry.
I don't know what to do, what can you advise me?
First of all, I think it's important that you get adequate support, so speak to your line manager and see if they can send staff possibly from another library to help your workload.
It's a situation which is presently counter productive because if you are stressed and need to take time off, it will only make the staffing situation worse.
Hopefully your boss will be able to appreciate that.
I can give you some anti depressants.
Would you be happy with that?
Yeah, I could go talk to him, but I'm afraid, he's on edge right now.
Last time he didn't greet me very well.
Send him to me - I need more clients!
He didn't greet you well?
What exactly did he do?
Haha, that would be an idea.
Maybe he's gonna cry in the bathroom every once in a while.
We should do group therapy.
He didn't give me time to explain my situation, and threw me out of his office with more work than before!
I would report him to someone higher up the chain.
He may be suffering himself, but bullying you needs reporting.
My goodness, your work environment doesn't sound very happy and uplifting.
Perhaps someone is going around putting drugs in your food.
Are your catering department reliable?
I must admit, when I taste the meals we serve, I ask questions...
Besides, there's no time to take a nap from the workload, it's a scandal!
It sounds rather suspicious to me.
If you could sneak out from there, some small food samples, I can send them away to get tested.
You can taste it, but I'm warning you, it's terrible.
Don't worry, I wouldn't taste it myself.
If my suspicions are correct, to do so, would mean coming down with depression.
I can't take time off and I like being happy.
Anyway, lovely to see you again, and we'll speak again when you get the samples.
Goodbye!
Thank you for your help, Doctor.
It was a pleasure talking to you today!
It's a lovely day for feeding ducks.
That's true, but I like to come here even when it rains.
After all, ducks eat every day!
Do you come here often?
My first time at this particular pond.
Are you new to the neighborhood?
No, I am just passing through.
I have a few hours to spare before catching my train.
Oh, where are you going?
Now that would be telling.
Just on the way to Cirencester.
The funny thing is I have no idea where I am now.
We're in the Alan Turing Foundation.
For me, it's especially the closest park in my house.
And since he's got a pond and some ducks, I come here a lot.
I like ducks a lot.
How did Alan Turing find the park?
I suppose he just looked around and there it was.
lucky for me I had some bread in my bag or the ducks would have gone home with empty stomachs.
I'll have some more if you want.
I always bring too much.
And there's a lot of kids, sometimes grown-ups, and they're happy that I give them some bread to throw in the ducks.
No that is alright.
I can hear my train whistle blwoing so I should run.
Nice talking to you.
Hello!
How nice to see you!
What a pleasure to meet you.
How are you?
I'm as well as can be expected.
I've got my aches and pains but at 93 I can't grumble.
How are you and the children?
They must be growing up fast.
It's hard sometimes to get old.
I understand.
And 93 is an age beyond honor and you always have a good eye.
The kids are fine, thank you.
They're almost grown now.
Paul's studying architecture.
That's marvellous.
And what about Emma?
She had a talent for music if I remember.
Emma's a senior scientist in high school.
She's graduating this year.
She goes on with the music and part of a symphony orchestra.
That's good to hear that she has kept the music up and will have a good career.
I miss playing the piano.
We don't have one here and the only music I do is to join in with the weekly song-song.
Don't you have a chance to get a loan from a charity?
I know there's a lot of musticists working with the nursing homes.
Don't you ever perform with musicians?
Just the weekly song?
I don't know about loans.
A piano is a big thing though it would be good if there was a keyboard.
I could have a tinkle in that.
The sing-song.
- dear me, that is a dreadful thing.
Terrible songs and my terrible singing"
You're going to get addressed to the living council of the house.
He could certainly put you in touch with a charity.
Is it so bad the songs?
What are they?
From what era?
I think I heard the bell for the evening meal.
Will you stay for some food or do you have to leave now?
We don't plan on staying for dinner and you know better than to call.
I hope I can come back soon and we can arrange for me to stay for dinner with you.
Thank you so much for coming to see me.
it means so much to me to keep in touch.
I hope you can come again soon.
It was very nice to meet you, too.
I'll be back.
Maybe next week.
These unfortunate ducks are very thin.
Have you got bread to give?
I have a few slices.
It's been a hard winter for them and I don't think they've had very much to eat.
They've started to build their nests, so they will need some fat on them for when they are sitting on eggs.
Hey, you seem to know these brave ducks.
Where did you learn all this?
I'm a keen ornithologist.
I spend weekends studying birds and looking for rare species.
What are your hobbies?
I see you're a specialist!
I also like to walk around and listen to birds, but I don't know anything about it.
What rare species are you looking for?
Nightingales are quite rare.
They sing beautifully.
But when it comes to birdsong, I love the cheeky sound of the blackbird.
I don't think you can beat waking up to the noisy sound of the birds.
You've travelled in distant countries to see and listen to some very rare species?
Yes, I was in Sri Lanka recently and saw some wonderful birds and animals.
Have you travelled much?
Yes, very much, especially in South America where there are extraordinary animals in the Amazon forest.
Did you get a chance to get there?
There's some amazing birds in Brazil.
No, I would love to go to South America and particularly Brazil.
It would be incredible to see a Toucan in the wild.
I need to save up enough money to go there.
Yes, a trip to South America costs enough.
I'd like to go to Argentina and see the condors.
I've heard that Argentina is a beautiful country too with stunning landscapes.
It's a country I know very little about.
I will have to do some research.
We have to go south to Fire Nation.
Chile too is a beautiful country.
You'll find more animals there than those poor ducks!
Hi, how are you?
Hello, I am great thank you.
How are you doing today?
I'm fine.
It's a good time to feed the ducks.
Why is that?
Because they are hungry
They look hungry.
What shall we give them to eat?
I have heard that bread is not the best for them, what do you think?
He was leaving that giving ducks bread is not good for them.
Better give them carrots.
Haha!
The carrots might sink before they have a chance to eat them!
It doesn't float carrots?
If we reach out, maybe they'll come for lunch.
At worst, they'll go down.
Hopefully they won't sink while eating, that would be a sad lunchtime for them.
Maybe we could try and stroke them?
If we make duck noises they might come over!
Shall we try?
Yes!
Let's try
Corner little duck, come over here we have something to eat.
Quack Quack
Yes!
He came over.
He took the carrot from your hand!
Let's just use it to stroke him before he leaves.
Ah, too late.
He got scared.
All he left was feathers on the way out.
Maybe he'll get caressed next time.
We should go home.
Good evening, my friend.
How are you this evening?
I've got terrible flatulence my friend.
The food here is terrible!
Oh, my poor old man.
I brought you a bottle of wine, no one saw anything.
Here, I'll hide it for you.
Thanks but aren't you going to have some with me?
It's up to you.
You can keep it for yourself, we can drink from two, or we can also invite the nurse that I ran into the hallway when I came in.
She's all right!
Yes, it's fine.
Most of the old folks in here don't know what day it is and wouldn't notice anyway!
I know which nurse you mean - she gave me a nice massage earlier!
Massage?
Did you pay her for that, or do you think she likes you?
Yes, the nurses gives us massages all the time.
I get most of them though.
The nurses seem to be queuing up!
She wouldn't take any money from me.
She says her services are free but I'm not sure what she means?
Hmm, that's nice, but a little weird, isn't it?
I mean, whatever!
What matters is that there's a pretty nurse like that giving you massages.
So, shall we open this bottle of wine?
Yes, let's get it opened.
I've got two nice wine glasses in my bedside cabinet.
I've also got some playing cards here.
Shall we invite one or two of the others and we can all play poker?
That's a good idea.
You want me to knock on doors, or do you have specific people in mind?
Anybody, Just make sure you avoid door number 6.
The lady in there is bonkers, and hurls abuse at everybody!
All right, I'll look for people and I'll be right back!
I'll be right back.
I am worried about my mother.
Tell me about your mother.
Why are you worried about her?
Well I am more worried about what she makes me do!
Oh?
What's she doing to you?
I never seem to get any time on my own.
She is always there.
She tells you all the time what to do and how to do it?
Well, no not really, but it's like she is watching me.
And you feel like she's on trial?
More like me being on trial.
and I think she follows me...
Is she following you?
In town, everywhere?
Not everywhere but yesterday I was in a coffee shop and I saw her at the door.
When I looked up she was gone!
Are you sure it was her?
To be truthful...
I am not sure anyone was there
Who were you spying on?
Why do you think I was spying?
No, no, I was asking you who was spying on the door.
It was a woman in a black coat carrying an umbrella
She had long blonde hair tied in a bun.
And your mother looks like that?
sort off... it is like the photos of her as a young woman.
But it probably wasn't her, then, was it?
What did you have to do with your mother when you were a child?
That's what I meant about not being sure anyone was there.
I used to have a photo of her pinned on the wall next to my bed
I used to cry a lot.
I remember that
Did she take care of you much?
When she was at home yes, but I remember her being away from home a lot.
Did you miss her when she was far away?
Yes
but I don't think she was that far away.
Unfortunately, our time is up, it's time for my next patient.
You'll be back next week, same time, same time?
Thank you doctor
yes I think my mother is waiting for me
Good night
Hey, you, did you just get in the neighborhood?
This is the first time I've seen you, and you're at the regular table!
Sorry.
But I don't like being addressed as 'Hey, you.' How was I to know what table to sit at?
I'll sit at the bar.
If that's allowed?
Oh, you've got character!
Don't get upset!
Can I get you something?
Are you waiting for someone?
I think we got off to a bad start.
I'm not upset.
Your tone seemed unwelcoming.
I'll have a red wine and yes I'm waiting for a friend.
Any more questions?
I'm sorry I didn't want to rush you.
I can offer you the wines of the days that are on the slate there.
Is there a wine that is particularly local?
You might be better off at the back table over there?
It's kind of cozy, a little away from the rest of the customers.
We only have local beer, wine comes from Bordeaux or the Coast of the Rhones.
Ah I understand now.
When you said regular table I thought I was sitting at another customer's regular table.
Can I have a beer?
Yes, you see, there are 12 and come every day at 2: 00.
They are real drunks, I suggest you step away if your date is a little more...
Sure, I'll bring the beer.
OK.
I see what you mean now.
Thanks.
Your friend doesn't seem to be here.
Do you want me to keep you company?
Oh that's very kind of you.
She'll not be long.
Let me introduce myself.
My names Esther.
What's yours?
My name is Mathilde.
Do you live around here?
It's rare to see any new faces.
Sorry got to go.
See you tomorrow.
Okay, I'll see you tomorrow!
Good afternoon to you!
Good morning, Maria!
How are you?
So so.
The leg's playing up a bit.
And the nurses keep disturbing me every time I nod off.
You can never get any peace around here!
It's true, they spend their time bothering us.
She's moving objects in the rooms.
She tells us to go here, do that, pfft.
Who's that?
I can't see very well anymore.
Why is there a woman in my room?
And you shouldn't be complaining!
You get to stay at home and live you life, while I'm stuck in here.
I was kidding!
They're doing it for your own good.
For my own good?!
That's it, that's it!
You've been talking about me behind my back.
They've turned you against me, I know it!
Come on, come on, you know I would never do that!
Tell me about your day.
What did you eat?
I knew it!
You have been talking to the nurses.
They've been trying to get me to eat all day.
Except I'm too smart for them.
I know they're trying to poison me you see.
So I've kept a little stash of sweets here under my pillow.
That way I'll never starve.
Stop talking nonsense, they would never do that.
It's spring, how about a way out in the park?
We could arrange this for a weekend of May.
I'll ask Marcel, Jeannine and Leon if they want to come.
I'm not friends with Jeannine anymore.
She keeps stealing my crossword.
And I'm sure she snogged Leon behind the medicine cupboard last Thursday.
Too bad, we'll do it without them!
Hello there
Good evening.
How are you?
Very well thanks, and you?
How do you think you are getting on with your Maths exam revision?
I'm fine, thank you very much.
I'm not sure, actually.
I'm having a little trouble understanding the differential equations.
Can you help me, please?
Of course!
What exactly are you struggling to get the hang of?
Unfortunately, I didn't understand the last sentence, can you rephrase that?
Of course - which concepts are you needing assistance with?
Thank you.
I need an explanation about derivatives.
I'm having trouble understanding the principle.
No problem - is it differentiation or integration you're needing help with the principle of?
Is it okay that the exam will cover all of the concepts that you saw in the second semester?
Yes, everything in Term 2 will be assessed in full.
Is there anything further I can help with today?
My next lesson starts shortly so I don't have much more time unfortunately.
No problem, that's a lot.
Thank you for your time.
No problem, enjoy the rest of your evening!
Hey, let's go swimming:)
Nah.
I'm fine here thanks.
But you could get me a drink if you like.
Okay, but only if you drop your book.
Why?
What's wrong with me reading?
Am I bothering you?
I can't see how... Why don't you join me?
Haha!
No problem!
You're just too lazy with this great weather!
Come on, let's go.
Really?
Why can't we just stay here a bit?
I'm making the most of the sun right here.
You should do the same.
Oh, no, we'll spend all our time in the sun.
Oh yes!
I'd rather go out and enjoy the water and freshen up.
Come with me!
It'll do you good, you'll see
Plus I have a frisbee!
It'll be fun!
But we need more people to play proper frisbee.
Otherwise it's just like throwing a plate back and forth.
Haha
Show me how you do it, I don't want you to be ashamed of yourself right now!
Why would I be ashamed?
I know that I'm pretty good.
I don't need to prove it!
Bring me a team of people and I'll play.
And a cocktail.
Please.
I don't think you're gonna make it up to him.
Okay.
So a long island for ma'am, and I'm going to look for Sasha and Daniel, don't move!
Only once I've finished my drink!
I always play better after a little drink!
It's not too early for a cocktail is it?
It depends on the client.
If you want one, I'll do it.
Otherwise, I don't.
It's up to you to decide what's best for you... to a certain extent.
Oh, ok.
Well I could have one then, if you don't mind that is... Do you have a menu?
Are there any specials?
Would you like a cocktail with a piece of it?
We have some special plates.
Especially to share.
It's very good with a mojito.
I'm not that hungry actually.
But what do you mean by "a piece of it"?
You mean a board to share?
It's a board with specialities for a friend's drink.
Ok, I think I understand sort of.
But no thanks, just a nice cocktail.
Anything with rum, although I'm not a fan of mint.
Thank you!
In a nice glass with a funky straw if you have one!
No mint?
No problem.
Would you like a punch punch?
The recipe is made of rum juice, orange juice and grenadine.
Ah I'm not sure I know what a punch punch is, but why not!
Could you ask some pineapple instead of the grenadine perhaps?
Anything else, you decide!
Oh, and perhaps a bit of coconut milk if you have some.
A pina coladas?
Don't worry, I'll do it right now.
And a beautiful umbrella!
A board for eating at the same time?
I can do that to you.
Do you have any preferences?
Hmm, I wasn't that hungry.
But perhaps some chips would be good.
No sauce though - I like them plan, with a bit of salt!
And why not a burger and a salad too!
I meant plain for the chips, sorry.
Good in general I serve codfish and sweet potato chips with this cocktail.
Is that all right?
The hamburger will be here later.
Ok, I'll have the fish and chips for starter and I'll get the burger later!
I hope there'll be enough room for dessert afterwards!
You do do desserts, don't you?
Yes, we make desserts.
A very nice mango soup, by the way, if you're still hungry after your meal.
In the meantime, here's your number.
We call you when the cocktails and the board are ready.
Great!
Thanks!
I might be getting some shots later too, once my friends arrive!
Don't hesitate to come back.
Good night, anyway!
Thanks again!
Good evening!
May I have a caipirinha, please?
Sorry I am new here, I really dthink not know my cocktails yet
Could you tell me how to make it
You have to mix it with the hide-in with lime juice, sugar and ice.
Ok, shaken or stirred?
Do you want crisps, nuts or anything to nibble?
Shaken, I guess.
Crisps would be fine, I'm starving.
I haven't eaten anything all day.
Here is the menu
We do some great bar snacks
Ah, I thought it was free with the glass.
Or you could have something more substantial
I don't have much money on me.
The crisps in this little bowl come with your drink,
Okay, thank you very much.
Maybe you could have chosen a cheaper drink!
But then you're a new waitress, I come here often and I've never seen you?
Yes, I am definitely new here but as you are a regular you know how expensive the cocktails are here
You need to look after yourself and eat first before drinking;
Not that it is my business
Hey, you're not my mother!
It's just that caipirinha, it reminds me of my travels in Brazil.
I was only a bit concerned as you said you were so hungry and did not prioritise eating
When did you go there?
I would love to travel there
I worked there for six months as a waitress.
It was last year, I didn't know what to do after graduation.
Do you speak the language?, was it brilliant?
Yes, a little, but it gets forgotten.
Linguists are a funny lot!!
Have I got the right date?
Saturday 11 June?
Is that right?
It is going to be a lot of fun
Yeah, you have the right date, I'll confirm it.
Can you bring a couple of bottles of champagne?
I think it is probably better if you ask friends to bring a bottle
As I am your good friend I can tell you directly I don't think it is a good idea to ask for expensive champagne
You may make people feel uneasy
I can help you with lots of the other organising
Decorations, food, music and anything else
You're right.
Take cheap ingredients, it's only a birthday, not the reception of an amp.
Your birthday is important but I agree you don't have to spend a lot to make a great party
Sorry, I mean Ambassador.
What sort of music were you thinking of?
Do you have anything to play it on that would be loud enough?
Or do you have any friends who could play instruments?
I have a few friends who play folk type instruments; bagpipes, hurdy gurdy, clarinet and the violin
Maybe you would like that before rock music
The first one to come with a bagpipe will be sent directly back to Scotland.
It's my birthday, not a funeral.
Let's just stay rock
I won't share with my lovely musical friends your opinion!!
That's why they're your friends, not mine.
I was thinking of my french bagpipe playing friends, they play lovely french dance music
You could be open minded!!
If you heard good alternative music you might like it
Maybe when it is my party you can come and enjoy something new
That's why I'm listening to the good English pop rock, no French music, no coeds, no Breton.
I don't like Breton, all that moving slowly around in a line or circle - very dull
But it's supposed to be my birthday, not your party.
I demand the right to choose the music that I love at my birthday, would you?
I know, "it's may party I can cry if I want to " that is a good pop song !!!
I meant that when I have a party for my birthday you may enjoy some different type of music but for your party rock/pop will be great
It is your choice after all
I don't know it, but you can play it or play it to me if you want, but it's forbidden to cry at my parties, except for joy.
I was only being humourous
It is a song by Lesley Gore from the 1960's, you should listen to it on youtube
Send me the link.
I will do tomorrow
What about food?
Have you had any thoughts?
Let's keep it simple.
Hi, is this the first time you've been on a plane?
Do I feel a little nervous?
No, it's not my first time flying, but I still get extremely anxious.
I don't know why.
Sometimes that doesn't explain...
And why are you traveling today?
I know.
I'm visiting my daughter who I've not seen for a good while.
I'm very excited to see her.
What about you?
Are you on business?
No, I'm on vacation...
You must be really happy to see your daughter.
I am. It's six months since I've seen her.
I have my case loaded with all the things she likes to eat and some toiletries she likes too.
She's gonna be really happy!
What's good for him?
Jam?
Cheese?
Chocolate?
No, she loves peanut butter, Shreddies (a type of cereal), chocolate biscuits, Hula Hoops (snacks)
and i've got her the soap she likes.
My bag is really heavy.
Will she pick you up at the airport on arrival?
Yes hopefully, although she said she might be late because she will be travelling through rush hour.
The plan is to get a taxi to her flat.
What are you planning to do on your holiday?
Taxi sounds like a good idea!
On my side, I plan on joining friends who live there.
The point is mostly to see them, but to take advantage of the city, and everything she can offer.
Well thank you for talking to me and settling my nerves.
Have a wonderful holiday!
Have a good trip, too.
Enjoy your daughter!
They say that flying is the safest form of transport, you know!
You shouldn't worry so much.
Oh, I know.
But you know, being a little stressed out on planes is not a rational thing.
There's something really unnatural about an object so big and heavy that a plane can be suspended from 10 miles above the ground.
Well, imagine when space travel becomes commercialised.
That's going to be a bit of a shock for you isn't it!
Oh, yeah, tell me about it.
But at the same time, being away from the earth, without gravity, it's different.
We're not going to fall apart, since there's not really up and down.
No, in space, actually, it's more like a submarine.
The spaceship has to be solid, 'cause if there's a hole in the hull, we'll probably be dead soon.
Like a submarine.
It's absurd, but I think I'd be less afraid.
Well, can you not force yourself to be rational about it?
Being in space is worse than being here now.
Are you really still scared after what you just said?
Yes, absolutely.
It's not really fear, the rest.
More like some kind of stress.
But you're not nervous about it, are you?
Even when there's turbulence?
No, it's like a rollercoaster.
It's amazing!
And they have amazing service.
I love it when they give free food!
Especially when there's turbulence and all the tea and coffee goes everywhere!
That's really hilarious.
I'll give you that, it's fun.
But it's also awfully stressful for people like me.
Ah, don't worry.
They're bringing the duty free round soon.
That should make you feel a bit better, surely!
We'll see.
Thank you for your support, anyway.
So have you made a guest list for the party?
Are there particular people you want to invite?
I don't know.
Well, it depends on where we set it up.
If we're doing this at my house, I can't invite over 15 people.
Why not?
I know you dont have much space but parties go better when everyone is squashed together.
Or are you worried about the neighbours?
We can invite them
That's true, we could.
Plus, the third neighbor is really pretty good.
Have you seen her before?
Ah yes, she would be good fun.
Do you think we need to provide a lot of food, or just drinks and snacks?Providing a lot of food makes it all more complicated.
We could even ask people to come with stuff, right?
Drink or food, by the way.
Good idea, that makes it all much easier and more relaxing.
Do you have enough plates and galsses?
I could bring some spares, or we could hire glasses fro the supermarket.
Maybe get some ice from there too.
We can buy plastic plates, it's easier, right?
Same with the drinks and the silverware.
We can schedule basic stuff, like chips, wine, beer, and cold cuts.
I hate plastic plates, I'd much rather have proper ones even if it means more work clearing up.
I don't mind doing that.
Is there going to be a theme, or should people just bring whatever they like?
Then we'll make sure we don't starve to death.
Okay, plates.
No, there's no need to complicate things with a theme.
Do we have vegans or vegetarians amongst our friends?
Its always good to have some meat free dishes anyway so vegetarians can just avoid the ones with meat.
But vegans, well, I think if anyone is that fussy they should make their own arrangements!
I agree.
Well, you know, we'll take care of the raw vegetables, like everyone else.
All right, look, I think we're all gone.
I'll think about the guest list.
I have to leave you for now, but thank you for all your advice!
You're welcome!
Good morning, ma'am.
Lie down, I'm listening.
Do I have to lie down?
I'd prefer to just sit.
I'm feeling a little bit apprehensive about this.
No problem.
What are you worried about?
Oh, you know... everything.
I don't know where to begin.
Then let's start with simple questions.
Yes please.
Were you ever worried about going back into my office?
I'm sorry.
I don't know what you mean.
I'm not worried about talking to you.
I'm worried about... I seem to worry about everything.
My job.
My husband.
My children.
It's all very overwhelming.
And I talk too much.
Thank you for talking.
It's important that I test your concern.
If you're not worried in my office, it's a good thing you're not afraid to talk about yourself.
It's a big step!
Do you know how long you've been feeling all these concerns?
It started this year.
When I was offered promotion.
I turned it down.
What do you think you're afraid of?
Responsibility?
Fear of failure?
Anything else?
Yes.
No,
I don't know.
I hate my job but I don't want to leave it.
Um... how exactly do you manifest your fears?
I have difficulty sleeping.
I lose things.
I forget stuff.
Um... sorry what was the question?
Well, the subject seems serious to me.
So I suggest we meet once a week for six months.
For today, that'll be $150.
Luckily I am descended from extremely rich royalty so that won't be a problem. Make it twice a week and double your fee.
Nice talking to you.
I feel better already.
This is very inconvenient!
Oh, no, that's not possible!
I have to go pick up my kids in five minutes.
I have to tell the school that I'm gonna be late.
Never mind your kids what about my meeting with our new clients.
They'll be arriving in 3 minutes!
Is this a very important appointment for you?
Of course it is ....do you have a phone?
If you send a message to the secretary, she'll warn them.
There is a problem with that .......
The secretary is ill today........
Think again ......I pay you to think.....we need solution
Ah, you want me to lend you my phone?
Yes please.
but we do not want the clients to know we are stuck in the lift do we?
Oh, yes, of course.
What are you going to tell them?
Could you say you're getting back from Los Angeles and your plane's been delayed?
I could call them, make them think I'm your secretary, and you asked me to warn them?
Good idea - now you are thinking .
With our company name being "Lift and Elevator Solutions ltd" we cannot possibly let them know that we are stuck in our own lift.
That's for sure!
I'll call them right away, so what's the number?
Oh no!!
It's on my computer......which is in my office.......this just gets worse and worse, there's only one thing for it.
We have got to get out of here!give me your phone
I got my ordninator in my backpack, like I said, I was gonna pick up my kids from school and I thought I'd work tonight at home.
We're gonna find their phones in my computer, don't worry.
Here it is, I'll give it to you.
In the meantime, I'll call the school and let them know I'm gonna be a little late.
Thankyou.
Your phone is very low in battery.
have you charged it up recently?
Oh no....it has just run out of battery.
We have no way of communicating with anyone.
Ah, that's getting really disturbing.
I hope the paramedics get here.
Don't panic - we're not injured!
Why don't we just press the alarm button.... and why didn't you think of that before?
I pay you to think!!
I believe this forest path leads us to a dead end.
Have you been here before?
It's getting dark.
It's problematic.
No, I don't know the area.
Do you think we should go back the way came into the forest?
Yes, I think it would be prudent to retrace our steps.
How long have we walked on this path?
That's a good idea.
What time is it now?
Do you have your phone or watch?
Yes, I have a watch.
My phone is dead.
It's 8: 00 already, it's getting dark.
Do you have any dinner?
Do you have an idea of how long it took us to reach this point in the forest?
I believe it's been four hours since we walked on this path.
I have some biscuits in my rucksack.
We had better move fast.
The problem is the light.
We may lose ourselves or trip over an obstacle and hurt us.
Yes, we must hurry.
Let's be careful in our steps.
And on your side, does your phone still own drums?
Four hours?
Luckily I have my phone on me so we had better alert our families and tell them about our problem.
Great, at least send a text to warn them.
We can use the torch in my phone .
Yes, but let's save it because it uses a lot of drums.
Do you have any warm clothes?
Good idea.
We had better get a move on.
With the night falling, it might get cold fast enough now.
Only a jacket and a scarf.
Let's try to walk a little faster to warm ourselves.
I think I still have some hot water in my bag.
Would you like some tea or coffee?
I would love some tea but we better not stop.
All right, we'll take it later.
Good morning ma'am, come in and sit down if you wish
Thank you.
I'm feeling a bit nervous to be honest.
It's normal, just relax and find out everything's going well.
Where do we start?
The best part is, you tell me why you wanted to come.
But you can also talk to me about something else.
I feel overwhelmed by everything happening at the moment.
It's as you wish.
Can you tell me more?
Work is stressful.
My husband doesn't understand how stressful my job is.
Did you tell her that?
What do you do for a living?
Yes, but he's very black and white about situations.
He says that if I don't like my job then change it.
I work as a project manager for a big corporate company.
He's unemployed at the moment and isn't making much effort to get a new job.
I understand.
His situation doesn't make him put himself in your position, because they have to spend some rather relaxing days.
He's resting a lot on you, obviously.
And I guess he's a little bored during the day and would like to find you more available at night.
Yes and I'm bringing in the money.
I can't afford to change jobs at the moment or be unemployed..
I don't think it's your place to change.
But rather to him to measure the stakes of your work and to support you when it is difficult.
It would help if he did more around the home.
I get in from work and still have to cook.
Do you have any suggestions as to how I talk to him about this?
You could talk to him about your feelings, tell him you're tired and you need his help, give him a reason to do it.
Hello, this is the first time I've seen you here!
Oh really?
That's funny.
I've been coming here a while.
It's lovely here.
Yes, it's very nice.
I try to give more to the ducks and swans than these greedy seagulls.
Careful!
Don't fall in.
Thank you, I tripped!
I wanted to see the ducks again, they're so cute!
Is that your dog?
He's lovely.
His name is Fetna, it's a long story.
I like to walk around here, have you ever been in the woods nearby?
Oh I never go near the woods.
Tell me about Fetna.
It's not a name I've ever heard before.
It's quite simple, actually.
She was born on the day of the holiday and so we agreed to call her Fetna, as in the calendar.
It's silly, but it made us laugh with my parents.
It's a good thing they didn't process their kids' names.
Why?
Because you'd be called Lent or something?
I'm afraid I am a bit of a heathen.
I don't know anything about holy days or religious events.
Sorry.
No.
Imagine being born on the day of Saint Ignatius, or Ascension Day.
Maybe it doesn't talk to you if you're not used to religious calendar, sorry.
Ha ha!
No I see what you mean now.
Oh look, is that a Heron over there.
How beautiful!
I must take a picture of it.
Don't get too close!
It's a really nice place.
Do you live far from here?
Wait, I have to catch my dog.
I have to go.
I live over there.
Oh look I can't wait till you catch him. Might see you tomorrow.
Bye!
Chief, we're in charge of a couple of soles, so what kind of butter?
And what vegetables do we serve these fish?
We'll have a garlic butter to go with the soles.
We'll serve them on a bed of wiltes spinach and with French beans on the side
Chief beans?
I'd rather serve these soles with tagliatelles.
What do you think?
Well as you asked about vegetables, I only gave my choice of vegetables, not other accompaniaments.
I don't think pasta and fish go well together but we all have different preferences.
What do you think about dauphinoise potatoes?
No, no potatoes with a fish, depending on my taste.
I'd rather serve the sole of sole on a vegetable bed.
What do you think, sir?
Vegetable bed it is.
The customer can always add a side order of potatoes or pasta if they wish.
Now can you start prepping the sole.
Potatoes more dough, that seems a lot.
I'll serve the sole on a bed of fennel.
What's the wine?
A white or a rosé?
A crisp dry rose will go perfectly.
Now what for dessert?
I suggest a light dessert.
Maybe something lemony?
Lemon tart perhaps?
After a sole a light dessert sounds like a good idea.
Either a lemon pie or a rum pineapple.
Both my favourites.
Which do you prefer?
I'll let you choose as you'll be the one making it.
It's hard to choose.
Personally, I'll do pineapple slices with Armagnac.
What do you think?
Shall I make you a hot chocolate?
Everything will seem better after a nice warm drink.
That's sweet, but I prefer coffee.
With sugar but the ideal would be a caipirinha...!
Oh dear!
It must have been a really tough day.
Would you like to talk about it?
What went on at work in the end?
Did you manage to meet the deadline?
Yes, very hard day.
We have lost an important contract and we don't understand why.
Did they not explain why?
No explanations at all?
Yes, of course we had some explaining to do.
We don't, according to them, responded to all their technical requirements.
Besides, we were too expensive.
Whose job was it to negotiate the contract?
Surely there's some leeway to lower the prices a bit?
Let's go do some archery.
It was really good fun yesterday.
I'm sure you'd enjoy it!
Uhhhh, archery?
It's quite original.
Can we do this close?
I've never done this before.
You what?
Sorry, I didn't catch what you said - "this close"?
Yeah, I'm asking if we can shoot the archery nearby.
Oh yeah, just over there behind the tennis courts.
There are about 10 lanes and a couple of instructors.
Archery is a pretty tiring sport.
I'd rather stay by the pool.
That's so boring.
Oh come on, I've had enough of getting burnt in the sun and doing crosswords.
If you don't like archery, how about rock climbing?
Wait, that's quite tiring too...
What do you suggest ...other than staying by the pool of course!
I look great in climbing.
Where is it in the area the possibility of making this sport?
You can see them from here - it's not very high, but they have different levels of difficulty, so it's fun for the all the family, so they say!
Okay, but is there a guide to help us?
Yeah, there should be someone there.
At least somebody who can get us kitted out.
It's pretty safe, I'm sure.
So are you up for it?
I'd like to try climbing, but I'm wondering if it wouldn't be better to stay here quietly by the pool.
But you always want to stay quietly by the pool whenever we're on holiday.
I actually thought I'd managed to convince you for once!
Are you going to say the same thing tomorrow?
Maybe tomorrow I'll have a little more courage to go rock climbing with you.
Or, we could go now, while you haven't had enough time to change your mind about wanting to go!
Ah, but I'd like to go rock climbing with you, but not today.
Why don't we just take a couple fathoms in the pool?
Ok then, you mean do some lengths?
Why not - all the kids have left now so they won't get in our way!
Yes, it is.
We have the pool for both of us!
I'll race you to the other side!
No problem.
I'm sure I'll win.
Come on, let's go!
What's wrong?
I want to get off.
Can we get off?
Are you sick?
Do you want me to call the stewardess?
No, she'll try to get me to stay on.
But I really don't want to be on this plane.
Where are you going?
You're going on vacation?
Is this about work?
My boss won't be happy.
Yes, it's for work.
But I haven't prepared the presentation I'm meant to be doing whilst there.
And I really don't trust this thing to stay up in the air.
To be honest, I don't really trust anybody at the moment.
What's the presentation?
You may have time to think about it now.
I think we work really well here.
Once above the clouds, everything is calm, there's light, it gives you ideas.
And the plane is an extremely safe transport.
It's the safest way to travel in the air.
Well if you want to compare to catapults or defenestration, then you're probably right.
I'm not joking.
I'm getting off.
Wait!
They serve excellent petit fours after takeoff.
Do you like petit fours?
Yes.
But is it enough to compensate for being in this goddam prison?
It might be... What flavours do they have?
I get on a plane every week.
Sometimes even a few times a week.
That's really nice.
And today's team is one of my favorites.
They know me well.
They always give me extra cakes.
I'll ask them for you too.
Stay, you'll see, it's not as bad as you think.
It's very nice!
And when you get there, you'll be proud of yourself!
Well, ok.
If you're very sure.
I do like a good cake.
Oh, here's the hostess!
Christine, do you have any cake in advance for my friend is me?
It was his first flight and I told him your beautiful little ovens.
So, it's good?
Hmm mmm. It'll do.
Although I'm a bit worried about the fact that they have ovens onboard.
Ah!
We took off and you didn't even notice.
Look how pretty the clouds are up there!
Hello Miss could I talk to you for a few moments please?
I'm sorry, I meant Sir!
Well, tell me what brings you here
One of my friends is being bullied because he wears glasses and I want to help him.
How does wearing glasses play a role in these brutal acts?
They tease him and call him names like 'square eyes'
But that doesn't tell me what the glasses are doing in this case?
Well, it's because he is different to everybody else.
No-one else wears glasses and so the nasty boys call him names.
Maybe it's his glasses that are horrible!
Well even if they are people should be more sympathetic.
I think it would take a little more from your French.
Your words seem a little consistent, and I don't know what you expect from me.
Well, perhaps I need to explain.
I have come to speak to you because you are a teacher and other students are upsetting my friend.
The reason they are cruel to him is because he wears glasses.
I need your advice on how to help him.
Could you give all the students some glasses?
That would be silly
Well, then offer contact lenses to your student.
Is that still stupid?
Well, actually that might be a good solution, but I am only a child so I can't get him contact lenses.
I will suggest that he asks his parents for them.
In fact, it all depends on the shape of the glasses.
Yes, that might be part of the problem, they are very ugly.
For instance, if the frames are round, it may be the round form that irritates students rather than glasses themselves.
Does that suggest they go round in circles?
I'm thinking we might be going rpun
I'm sorry I didn't mean to press 'send'
No, not at all.
I wanted to say I'm thinking we might be going round in circles!
One question, Sandra:
Okay
Well, I'm aware that the problem is really taken from the head and requires a thorough reflection.
I suggest we hold it together for tonight and we'll take the question later.
I was happy to argue with you and am impressed by the depth of what you're saying.
There's a lot of ducks this year.
true.
i wonder why.
Was the work done recently near the other stables would not drive the ducks to migrant on this pond?
did the ducks use to live in the stables?
It's just like in Charlotte's Web, with all the animals living with each other
i wonder if they ever unionised against the dominant farmer upper class
sorry.
I'm just being silly.
how often do you come here?
i haven't seen you around these parts before
You're right.
It's true that I don't know that kind of ducks with the green collar.
the new socio-economic category: first the white collar workers, then the blue collar workers, now the green collars
Do you think the duck migrations would be caused by socioeconomic factors?
Maybe pollution has increased?
climate change
and Trump
everything is Trump's fault nowadays
It's true for short-term decisions, but I don't think current political decisions are already measurable on nature.
come on!
jump on the anti-Trump bandwagon!
there's plenty fo room!
Ah, but I don't support Trump at all.
I'm being practical face-to-face with the ducks.
righteous!
i hear you, brother!
let's fight the good fight and defend the rights of powerless duck populations everywhere
duck vigilantes!!
And the bees!
I'm very worried about the disappearance of the bees...
and the bees too
anything else?
what about dolphins?
they're cute and look good on posters
everyone loves dolphins
I know someone who didn't like dolphins because they don't have a mustache.
That person liked cats because they had mustaches.
a mustache?!
what are they?
gentlemen cats that drink cognac, smoke pipes and blather on about the Great Depression?!
Mustaches are what some men carry between the mouth and the nose.
And the cats, whatever they're like, have a moustache they use to run into a room.
You must have special cats if they drink brandy.
My cat doesn't already agree to drink soy milk, so cognac...
Hello.
I'm glad I've found you.
I've lost my way and have been walking in circles for ages.
Do you know the way out of these trees?
No, I've never been here before, but maybe we can try moving forward in the same direction.
Yes, but which direction?
I think I came from that way, but over there also seems familiar.
Isn't the moss still supposed to grow north?
At the worst, we pick at random, we'll end up on people's lives.
OK.
I suggest that we go that way and stick closely together.
The light is beginning to fade and we don't want to loose touch with each other.
Do you hae any food or drink with you?
Yes, I still have water in my bag.
Thirsty?
I am thirsty but I was hoping for something a bit stronger that water.
Anyway, can you let me have a bit of your water?
Yeah, here.
And if we stay stuck here too long, we can still try blackberries.
So what can I get you?
I'll get you a coffee, please!
I've got a drink here thanks.
Or do you mean for you?
A coffee lying there, that would be perfect.
With a little glass of water next to it.
Ok!
With milk?
Long or short?
Are you sure you don't fancy one of our new cocktails?
It's happy hour right now!
Without milk!
Is it happy hour already?
In that case, I'd like a little mojito...
That's a good mix!
A coffee, some water and a mojito!
Have you had a good day at work?
A big day...
Hence the necessary coffee, and a mojito...
And all alone too!
Aren't any of your colleagues going to join you?
I could get you some drinks for them in the meantime, if they're coming of course.
My boyfriend's coming to join me.
I think he'll have a mojito, too.
Great!
It's going to be a big night in here tonight.
We've got two stag dos in tonight!
No, I'm a woman...!
It's true that my construction outfit and short hair can make you doubt...
But I'm working as an engineer on a big site, and I didn't have time to change, or take a shower after a day in the field...
Oh no, not at all!
I think you misunderstood me.
All I said was that it's going to be busy tonight because we have two groups of lads coming in to celebrate.
Hence the "stag do".
I understand.
Is there going to be a bachelor party in the bar tonight?
It's going to be very lively.
Yes, there are going to be two of them!
And don't worry about the clothes.
I'm wearing something very similar myself!
How did we get here?
We have been walking in the forest for a long time and we seem to have come to a dead end.
I'm cold.
Do you know when we entered the forest?
And hungry.
Would you like my spare jumper?
It's been three hours.
No, you need it, too.
I have got some biscuits-would you like some?
What do you think we should do?
I remember when we were in front of a cabin.
We should find her.
Do you think we should retrace our steps?
It is not long till it will start getting dark.
I agree we should try to find the cabin.
I have some water -would you like some?
Great.
You thought of everything!
Let's try to keep the water and the cookies for later.
I'm not usually organised but I remembered the basics this time.
Do you have a torch?
No, unfortunately.
By the way, do you have your cell phone?
WEll, I suppose we could use my phone as a light.
Is your phone charged up?
You had the same thoughts as me!
I don't have any battery.
And besides, we don't have a signal.
WE will need to rely on my phone.
Oh dear that will be a problem .
WE had better get a move on.
Wait!
Where does the sun set?
It is setting in that direction-it must be the west!
Hi Miss Smith, can you explain how I do this piece of work please?
I don't really understand what it is I have to do.
What I'm asking you, it's a team effort, with other students.
You have to assemble groups of three students.
And prepare a chemistry experiment to present by oral to other students
To be honest, I don't like working in a team as I end up doing all the work and the rest of the team take the credit.
The equitable distribution of the stains is part of the elements that I'm going to evaluate.
OK.
That's fair.
I'll chose some people I don't normally work with.
How long do we have to prepare the experiment?
How long is the oral presentation?
You've got 15 days before the presentation date to get the job done.
And the day of experimentation, ten minutes of experience, and ten minutes of oral presentation with slides.
I have a lot of deadlines from other teachers and I've got a hockey trip for some of this time.
Is it possible to get an extension?
It seems a little difficult, because it wouldn't be fair to the other students.
Think of a very simple experience!
The goal is to teach you to work as a team and give yourself an oral experience.
How many marks is there and what is the distribution of the marks for each element?
Then the note is 30 points.
Ten points for experience herself.
Ten points for the oral speech following.
And ten points on the ability to work as a team.
OK.
I'd better get working.
Mis, I think the fire alarm has just gone off.
Do we need to evacuate?
It could be a fire!
Let's get out of the room quickly!
I'll see to my face, but I'm afraid it's Mr. Dupont, the other professor of Chemistry...
He does a lot of new experiments, but he's already turned the fire alarm off...
Maybe he'll be fired!
Hi, I m better when we get in the air
Why, are you afraid at the time of decolation?
i really dont like flying at all, but needs must
Is this the first time you've been on a plane?
It's an extremely safe transport, you don't need to panic.
i ve flown quite a few times but just feel stressed at the going up and down and obviously if there is turbulance
Planes are built so that they can resist very strong turbulence.
There's nothing to worry about.
i know the theory but anxiety is not always rational
i ll try to switch off and not think about it
ignore me if I start over breathing
You should try to sleep a little, it'll calm your stress.
Where would you like a glass of champagne?
It works, too.
i think the champagne sounds more fun
I m not one for sleeping in odd places
do you fly often?
Yes, very often for my work because I'm in charge of business and should visit a lot of countries.
And you, for what reason do you travel?
family stuff, my son lives in Paris
He comes to the UK often but his children are too little to travel much
Oh, right.
How often do you get to see them?
What ages have your grandchildren if it's not indiscreet?
You re meant to say I dont look old enough to be a grandma!
I see them about every 3 months
but I still dont like flying, although when I see their smiling faces it is worth my stress
they are 3 and 5
I understand perfectly.
I also have grandchildren and what do you intend to do with them in Paris?
Take them to the circus?
That is a good idea
I think I may try and sleep now after the champagne
thanks for helping me calm down
You're welcome.
I haven't been coping very well this week.
Whatever I do, I can't stop thinking about ice-cream. Wherever I go!
What can I do?
Let's say together with your difficulty.
Do you always think of the ice cream eating?
Or a mirror to look at?
I don't think a mirror will help.
It will just remind me of my inability to resist - I constantly have ice-cream round my mouth.
You see, I can't even pretend it's not happening!
So you have an irrepressible urge to eat ice cream.
Are there any special circumstances in which this desire to manifest itself in a more intense way?
It's especially at night.
My bedsheets are covered in ice-cream. It's awful - especially when the cat gets covered in it too!
And then trails ice-cream all round the house!
Especially at night?
That's very interesting.
Do you dream that you eat ice cream for the night before you wake up and eat them?
I usually raid the freezer, even when I'm asleep.
Once I even forgot to close the door and the whole thing defrosted over the kitchen floor.
And then there was no more ice-cream to eat at all!
So you eat ice cream while you sleep?
Tell me about your childhood.
Have you experienced an unhappy experience with ice cream?
Repressed trauma maybe?
Well, there was this one time when we got snowed in.
It was a really cold winter and it snowed for four days straight.
And my parents made me tunnel out of the house to get free.
Do you think that could play a part in all this?
Snow, ice-cream...
It's a very interesting story.
Because it could indeed be the point of departure from your trauma.
Do you, by any chance, consume white ice cream, or beige ones that might make snow think
I do!
My favourite is vanilla, followed by coconut, followed by almond-flavoured... But I'll eat any flavour you give me.
Well, well, we're moving on.
I was meaning to ask - would you like some icecream?
It's currently melting in my bag and I think we should save it before it does.
Well at least I can't be fired for being late for the meeting.
You'll be able to vouch for me!
Of course.
But let's take a look at the instructions in case of stopping the elevator between floors.
I push the call button.
Ok!
Does this happen often?
I usually take the stairs but was feeling lazy today!
Me, too, but since I'm very busy, I took the elevator, and I regret it as much as I am also waiting and that my cell phone has no service.
Since we're having an unexpected moment together, explain to me what you're working on right now.
Well, I did tell you at the meeting this morning.
But ok...
I'm organising the big event in London next week.
Lots of guests, lots of speakers!
I even have to organise catering!
I'm sure you're doing the best you can.
The big event you organized last year went beautifully.
Aw that's nice you remembered!
It's good to know our work is appreciated.
I mean, I've barely slept for the last couple of weeks...
Not that you work us too hard.
Well, you do work us hard and everything...
We all work a lot, especially right now, to prepare for this event.
I hope you can take a few days off after our homecoming meetings and enjoy your family.
Me too!
It's been a while since I've been on holiday.
I have to say that the pay isn't great here... I've actually been thinking about changing jobs.
I know I shouldn't be saying this to you though...
I'll think about what you just told me.
If everything goes as well this year as last year and we earn customers, I'll offer the management to make the performance of your team's performance and yours especially.
You mean a raise?
Or I could go up a pay grade perhaps?
I can't promise anything by myself.
Decisions concerning personnel are always taken in collegiate with management and human resources.
But I'll offer to study your situation.
Oh wow, amazing!
Thanks!
Who knew that lifts breaking down could be a good thing!
But I think it's very long for the paramedics to come forward.
I'm going to push the call button again.
Ok, I'm not sure we need paramedics, but let's give it a go.
Rescue officers are able to move the elevator to one floor and make the door open to free us.
Ok, and we might even still be able to make the meeting on time!
I'm really excited about my partner.
It would be great if you could help me organise it?
Sorry - that should say party
I'm not sure I understand.
What turns you on?
I'm excited about my party.
I don't know the word in French.
Can you help me organise it?
Of course, I can help you organize your party!
I'd like that.
Did you have any specific ideas?
I'd like to keep it quite small, say for around 30 people.
Some food and wine, maybe dancing.
Do you know anywhere I could hold it, like a bar or club?
I know several bars, which could very well greet 30 people.
Would you like a special atmosphere?
Somewhere not too noisy, otherwise it's difficult to hear people speak and where they would serve some good food.
It makes me think of a bar I know, who's got a lot of charm.
With a very nice musical background
And their kitchen is excellent!
That sounds great.
We could go and chat with the owner and see what he/she can offer?
Sometimes they charge for the space for the party.
Yes, it would allow you to see if the place suits you.
And discuss the financial aspect.
But also a menu.
I would like to bring my own cake as well.
And not all bars allows balloons.
It's possible in this bar.
They're offering a salty buffet with cuts and cheese and cheese and wine, and then you can bring dessert!
That sounds perfect.
Let's go tomorrow.
Put your phone away please it is not hygienic in the kitchen
Just get on and start prepping the vegetables for tonight
But euuuh!
No phone from Instragram.
I'm going up, but I'm keeping my phone nah!
Look I am trying to be considerate as I know you are having some personal issues but please get on with your work
The peppers need grilling and then peeling
The garlic needs roasting
Oh lalaa!
No garlic.
It gives me bad breath.
And with bad breath, impossible for me to show up in public.
I'll get the peppers ready and take a picture of them.
Give me the new subscriptions!
Ha-ha-ha.
You are not here to be a joker
You are a junior sous chef and you had better remember it
As for not liking garlic I am not interested in your likes and dislikes
I know a very good recipe for garlic soup which uses forty cloves
You can make that tomorrow
But that's not fair!
I'm a chef in the kitchen, but I'm a PR chef!
Perfume, pictures, reception, this whole thing suits me better than finishing the stove!
I refuse!
I say, I refuse to cook garlic!
My belels are going to stink!
As I said I am the boss and you will do as you are told
I am not interested in your opinions and what part of your anatomy will smell
Smelling of garlic will stop you flirting with the waitresses anyway
You're cruel!
What have I done to you?
Waitresses aren't interesting, customers do!
I have to earn a pair!
I'm an instargram and other social networks!
A star!
The fact that I go to the toilet brings me 2,000 I love.
I'm only doing this job until I get hired by a box of models!
I'm a star!
Let's go!
You are deluded
Well, since you are here you will do as I say and not spend your time fantasising
You are here to work to just leave now
All right!
I'm going to work.
I'm going to work in Chanel and resign from this rotten food job!
Honestly, using garlic doesn't suit a person of my caliber!
Farewell!
Hello, can I get you something?
I've had a rubbish day, so something strong would be good!
Do you do cocktails here?
Yes, of course!
What kind of alcohol do you like?
Something sweet, and something colourful would be nice!
I like it when there's sugar round the rim. Can you do that?
I think a tequila sunrise is exactly what you need!
But get something to eat with it.
Ok!
I'm feeling a little peckish.
What would you suggest?
Our fries are delicious.
And of course they're homemade!
Great!
I'll have some of those then!
And I'll probably get a dessert later too!
Do you know who that rowdy group is over there?
Will they be here all night?
It's a rugby team that celebrates its victory.
It's likely they're staying late.
They're very noisy, but very nice.
They'll change your mind after you've had a hard day.
Hmm, I'm not sure about that.
But maybe they'll be up for a bit of karaoke later.
What do you think?
I think so.
After a few drinks, they'll probably be ready for karaoke!
I'd better get drinking too then!
Do you ever have a go at karaoke too?
Is it allowed?
Yeah, we do that a lot.
It always puts a good atmosphere.
But we start a little later in the evening.
Probably around 9: 00.
I've got enough time to choose my song then!
Although I warn you, I'm not a very good singer.
I could empty this bar in seconds probably!
Good evening, miss.
What kind of gin do you have?
Oh, sorry.
There's not much light, and, from the back, your long hair misled me.
Anyway, what kind of gin do you have?
We have Gordon's gin only
That's it?
All other gins are sold out.
I'm sorry
Never mind.
Get me a gin and tonic, please.
Are you new here?
Yes, this is my first day in this job.
I'll get you your gin and tonic.
And what do you do otherwise?
Are you a student?
I am a philosopher, and I need this bar tender job to help me pay my rent
This is exciting!
What's your specialty in philosophy?
I am an existentialist, but there no paid vacancies for this, so I live in a small hut in the forest with my books, and work here to pay my way
I myself studied a bit of philosophy many years ago.
But I was more interested in questions linked to consciousness, ontology, phenomenlogy.
But you can't study everything, can you?
I greatly respect the view of Sartre.
However I've come to the conclusion, like many before me that pointlessness is life's final discovery, and that inconsistency is part of the human condition.
Maybe, I'll have a gin as well !
What do you mean "the tip"?
I think a gin would cheer me up, make me feel happier
Please, I'll give it to you.
And get me a gin and tonic, and I already finished mine.
So you studied Sartre?
One more gin coming up, did you want a sandwich ?
Yeah, I guess so.
What have you got?
Ham, cheese, pickle or a mixture of any of these
Put it all in, it'll be perfect.
Do you work here every day?
I only work here to provide enough money for food and rent, then I disappear into the forest to consider existence.
The bar owner is very kind
The bar is about to close.
Good night
Good night, and thank you for this evening!
Mon plaisir
I'm bored.
What are we gonna do?
You can't be bored
Look at the beautiful view
There are some beautiful people to look at too
I've been watching people around the pool for two days.
And there's no big world of interest
Well, go and talk to someone then or join in the the water exercise
Have you met anyone?
I think there will be bingo soon
Great, a bingo.
I hope there's a chicken to win.
What does that mean?
You might wanna n a few drinks or something
I think it's corny, the bingo, it reminds me of the village party.
Oh, yes, I would.
Leave me in peace for a bit while I snooze a bit
You know how hard I usually work
No, but it's too late now that you've offered it.
I'm ordering cocktails.
Forget your work, you've had enough sleep
Mojito for me please
I am definitely forgetting work but it does wear me out
You have to change your mind, the holidays are for that.
Come on, get up, you're not drinking lying down.
We've got to get to the bar.
Oh, ok, you are a hard task master
I dare nt say bossy
Cool.
The mojito has arrived.
I got some orange juice.
I'm thinking ablze.
Reasonable.
How about that fart?
Shall we?
Shall we see what is on the activity programme, maybe some archery or silly dancing
We could finish our drinks and investigate
Great.
Let's go investigate, I'd do some aqua pony.
I hope you were able to rest.
I hope you were able to rest.
See you next time.
Oh no, I think we're lost and it's starting to get dark.
Can you get a GPS signal on your phone to find out where we are?
I'm out of drums, unfortunately!
My phone is completely dead too.
Did you remember to bring the map?
I don't have the card, I lost it earlier.
We could camp here for the night and hope we can find our way in the morning when it's light.
What do you think?
Yeah, that's a good idea, but we don't have a tent.
Did you see a place to shelter nearby?
No.
I think we're just going to have to build a makeshift place to sleep with the branches and hope there are no wild animals in the forest.
Did you ever learn to make a fire with a flint?
Yes, let's hope so.
I'm afraid I've seen a wolf or a big, stray dog before.
For the flint, I have three boxes of matches in my left pocket.
That's a bit of good news about the matches.
Animals don't like fire.
I have some ham sandwiches I can give them if they come too close.
Have you got anything to give them?
I'm gonna make a fire to get them away;
Would you like some tea or coffee?
I got some hot water left in my thermos.
Yes please, that would be great.
I've got some chocolate biscuits left too, although they've melted a bit in the heat.
Great!
Do you have any sugar?
No, I'm afraid not.
Can you hear that noise?
It's a bit scary.
I hope it's someone who has come to rescue us!
Wolf howl?
Maybe.
Light the fire quick!
My matches are all wet, alas!
However, I hear voices nearby and I seem to distinguish a flashlight.
What a relief!
I didn't want to die here!
Want to play a game?
Not at the moment, I'm enjoying the sun and relaxing
Maybe later
You're not gonna stand there and do nothing!
I'm too hot to do anything at the moment.
Can you get me a nice cold drink with some ice please
It's okay that you're warm, you're in the sun.
Okay, I'll get you your drink.
You want some water?
Thank you.
I was thinking of something a bit more exciting like a gin and tonic
Here's your gin and tonic, but you shouldn't drink in the sun.
Why?
Is it bad for me?
You might get drunk faster, it might even be dangerous to go in the pool!
I've not heard of that before.
Perhaps I should eat something as well.
Did you notice any food available at the bar?
Yeah, I think there's some sandwiches.
I'll do a deal.
If you get me a ham and cheese sandwich, I'll play a game after.
Ah!
All right!
Here's your sandwich!
Didn't you get something for yourself, you must be hungry?
While I was making your sandwich, I got one, too.
Nice of you to ask.
Shall we play badminton or tennis?
Badminton!
It's my favorite sport.
Great!
Sounds like you are good.
I'll get the racquets
I've had a terrible day.
Hope the cat isn't around or I will kick it.
Horrible?
What happened?
But that's no reason to take it out on our cat!
First the train was late so when it came it was full and there were no seats left.
Then when I apologised for being late for a meeting I realised I had left my papers at home.
Keep the cat out of the way!
I see...
Then I realised I had got your glasses and not mine.
Hope you weren't too annoyed by that.
Have you been able to participate in the meeting anyway?
Oh, yeah, I saw about the glasses, but I didn't have to drive, so that didn't embarrass me too much.
I had to wing it at the meeting.
Someone said I was better than usual but I think they were just poking fun at me.
You think they made fun of you?
It's not certain!
Maybe having to improvise without documents has made you more synthetic.
And, as you know very well, you had to be perfect!
No, maybe I'm just paranoid.
But when we got in the lift my boss started to tell me this ghastly story about how he and someone else got lost in a forste.
And then the lift broke down between floors.
I was stuck in the lift with my boss!
Synthetic!
Now your're making fun of me.
No, I'm not.
Well, I think you've had a really bad day, and you're mostly in a bad mood...
While the lift was stopped he said we should use the time doing my appraisal!
I'm always in a bad mood.
Sorry, I haven't asked how your day was?
But, no, you're not always in a bad mood... but tonight, you definitely are!
At the same time, after the day you've passed, that makes sense..
I had a good day...
That's probably why I see things more serene.
I would go for a lie down to calm down a bit, but I see the cat is on the stairs.
Have you left any wine or have you finished the bottle?
But leave that poor cat alone... take a glass of wine, there's more.
Thanks I will have a big glass and try to forget about the day.
What would I do without a sympathetic ear when I get home.
Hi, this is my first time flying and I have to admit that I'm a bit nervous
Have you flown before?
Yes
I take it very often!
Almost every week for my work.
You'll see, the journey will go well, I'm sure!
I'm quite scared in fact.
What is that strange noise and shaking?
It's perfectly normal.
I was very scared, too, when I started getting on the plane ten years ago.
And I even trained to learn how to not be afraid of flying!
Really!
that's reassuring
Maybe I should order a drink from the drinks trolley to sooth my nerves.
Would you like one?
It's a good idea to relax!
But I'll have a coffee instead...
I got up a little early to get on the plane, and I need that coffee to wake me up a bit!
OK.
I'll grab the stewardess when she passes.
Would you like anything to eat with your coffee?
What do you do for work?
I could eat a croissant with coffee.
Good idea, I'll get one too.
I usually only eat croissant on special occasions.
I'm a chocolatier.
Flying for the first time is a bit of a special occasion.
That's for sure!
Oh wow!
What a dream job
But since I'm a bit greedy, I tend to eat croissants often!
Yes, it's a fantastic job!
Which chocolate company do you work for?
I'm an auto contractor, and I'm working on my account.
I'm not sure what that means, but you are definitely someone to stay in touch with!!
I adore chocolate
Ah, the order of eight has arrived.
The entrance is just two melon soups.
You remember the recipe, don't you?
Oh dear!
I’m not sure I remember it.
You will need to refresh my memory.
It's very simple.
Take a melon, cut it in two, remove the seeds, and get the meat from the melon with a spoon.
Put the flesh in the blender.
Then what do you put in the blender?
I put in some lemon juice and a little water.
Is that right?
That's good.
More mint leaves.
Ah yes!
I forgot about the mint leaves.
I need to be careful not to add too many though, or they might overwhelm the melon flavour.
Absolutely.
So you mix, and it's almost ready.
All you have to do is train.
Get back to half-melons.
Cut off a tiny little bit of the skin below, so they can stand up the plate.
Pour the soup in, and put a sheet of mint over it to decorate.
What do you say?
That looks perfect.
Should I garnish it with anything else?
Would you like me to add a piece of Melba toast on the side?
No, no, it's no use.
It's good like this, light, fresh!
Send it to the gym.
Next order...
A pickled salmon plate.
That's easy!
Do you want me to let you do it?
Yes.
I can do that easily.
Shall I use a little dill to garnish?
I didn't quite understand that question.
What do you mean by toppings?
I mean shall I put some dill on the side of the plate as decoration.
Presentation is important, isn’t it?
Absolutely.
Yeah, that's a great idea.
Do it and send it to the gym.
I’m afraid that’s The end of my shift now, Chef, so I’ll have to catch my bus home.
Good night.
I’ve learned a lot from you this evening.
Welcome back, and see you tomorrow!
Hi, I'm having coffee with an orange juice, please.
would you like milk with your coffee and ice in your orange juice?
No thanks no milk in my coffee and no ice in the orange juice.
Here you are.
Would you like to order any food?
Our special dish today is chicken pie with roast potatoes and green beans
No, thank you.
Just coffee.
Chicken pie?
It's very original.
Yes, it's chicken cooked in a lovely cream sauce encased in pastry.
You can always change your mind!
Is that your dog that's just wandered in over there?
It seems to be looking for someone.
Probably delicious, but I just want a coffee with an orange juice.
Cream chicken?
Amazing!
If it is yours, I'm afraid we don't allow dogs in our bar for hygiene reasons
Sorry, but the dog in question is not mine!
Hhmmmn, hold on while I put it outside.
Poor thing, it's raining too and looks hungry.
I don't mind having a dog with us.
He's probably better off with us than outside.
Well as you don't mind, I'll get him back in and give him some chicken pie.
Are you enjoying your coffee
?
You think your dog will like chicken pie?
I'm not sure.
Your coffee's not bad.
I also asked for an orange juice.
Oh yes, sorry I forgot.
Here's your bill, it comes to 14 euros
Hi!
Hey, it's my birthday.
Don't you want to help me set something up?
I said I would, didn't I?
So here I am. What do you want me to do?
Great!
Thank you!
I was thinking about doing this next Saturday.
Maybe a restaurant?
Oh.
I thought it was today.
I'm busy Saturday.
That's a problem.
Oh, man.
My birthday is today, but I thought there'd be more people on the weekends.
Can we reschedule for Sunday?
Well as we've not scheduled the party yet we don't have to reschedule it.
We can just invite people on the Sunday.
Do you have a favourite restaurant?
Oh and are you paying for everything?
Uh...
Do you know a good one?
It's not too expensive in general...
There's that new Italian place but I'm not clear about who's paying.
Do you want your guests to pay for their own mean or will you pay for eveything?
If it's not too expensive, I can afford the drinks and everyone pays for the food they order...
But I don't like Italians too much...
That sounds like a good plan.
Ah.
So a cheap French place.
How about Chez Maurice in the Square?
You know an Indonesian restaurant?
Or the Thai limit?
What do you mean by the Thai limit?
We could invite our yoga group and the Glee Club...
A Thai restaurant.
I know a couple of Thai restaurants but they're not cheap.
Don't you know anywhere?
I think there's one in the old harbor.
I'll look into it.
Can you get in touch with the yoga group and the Glee Club?
Yes I'll do that.
Can I invite them all?
There's over thirty people in the yoga class.
Oh, no!
Tuesday's little band.
You know, it's only 8 on Tuesday.
The rest of us don't know them so well.
So, I take care of the restaurant and you invite the friends, and we'll talk about it tomorrow?
Oh them!
Yes.
Glad I asked.
Yes I'll get in touch with them for you.
I'm not convinced a restaurant is a great idea for such a, potentially, large gathering.
You could use my flat.
Ah!
That's a great idea!
You wouldn't mind?
No.
So long as you supply the drinks and help me clean up afterwards it'll be a lovely way to invite as many as we like.
And Gerard might come along.
You never know.
If you know what I mean.
Yes, of course.
Great, let's do it this way!
And we can cook together in the morning!
I can't wait!
Can I talk to you tomorrow to complete the organization?
Cook?
Oh dear.
That might be a problem. But I haven't got time to tell you why.
How about ordering Thai food from that restaurant?
I have to go!
Let's speak tomorrow.
We'll find a solution.
Great!
See you tomorrow!
Ciao!
Have I ever seen you around that pond?
Wasn't it yesterday?
maybe.
i tend to keep to myself.
that being said, i do come here every day so you probably did see me
I like to come to this park, too.
I think the place is really quiet.
it is rather quiet.
i just wish they hadn't put in the playground over on the other side.
the children are so noisy, i'm afraid they are going to scare away the ducklings
I think they're planning a soccer game today between the city's different neighborhoods.
It's too much of a risk to become unbearable.
what?!
that's ludicrous!
there are stadiums for that sort of shenanigans
I believe the new municipal team wants to promote exchange.
exchange programmes with foreign students?!
what kind of exchange do you mean?
Not even close.
Just the children of the different neighborhoods.
oh.
like some wort of community development programme to get kids to play together
well that's nice.
i just hope they don't make too much of a ruckus
There you go.
So the West Side kids meet those from the East Side.
breaking down gang warfare one soccer game at a time
It's true that security issues have gone up.
i hope it works.
i'm tired of all those tragic stories you hear about young kids getting caught up in petty disputes between rival gangs
just look at how the ducks and swans get along!
we should take a leaf out of their book, if you ask me.
That's right.
We're all forced to live together.
'forced' is probably a little strong.
as they say, "if you don't like living here, then go live elsewhere'
When we were born here, it's hard to go to another country.
We're losing all its landmarks.
landmarks, like the pond and the park?
For example.
Or his doctor's choice.
It's not easy to find a new doctor that works when you change town.
Or just find a supermarket that sells products I'm used to.
Do you want an outdoor party as the weather is so good
Yes, of course!
I think we should go to the park next, we can have a barbecue.
Barbecue or something more sophisticated?
Oh, no, we're between us!
I'm not planning on inviting the Queen of England!
Or the new royal couple, haha!
I ll wear a very smart dress so it will feel as if I m at something royal
Mind you, I m very happy to be celebrating with you
Yes, it'll be fun!
You gave me an idea: Let's make a royal barbecue!
Dress code princier
The wedding was stunning was nt it
We will have fun too
Shall I organise the barbecue meat and fish
Then we could ask friends to bring salads and wine
Yes, why not!
I'm gonna make cake for dessert.
Chocolate?
I don't know if dinner will be as beautiful as last night in Windsor but we're gonna try!
I had a croque en bouch for my wedding!!
Yes, a chocolate cake, and another apple I think.
What did you get?
Very French but much better than our traditional fruit cake
Luck!
You think I should do that?
Are you going to wear a princess crown as the special birthday girl?
Sorry I don’t understand what you mean
Yeah, I think I'm gonna wear a nice solid gold tiara, with a lot of diamonds!
It's gonna be really beautiful.
I was talking about dessert, but I think I'm gonna make it easier for you.
Good lord, I hope there won’t be any strange people in the park
About the meat and fish, I'm also going to take a few things for vegetarians.
You never know!
We might be mugged!
Haha
Yes, that's for sure!
Perhaps you could bring a sword, as a true knight of the Crown!
Ha ha!
I ll make food suitable s for everyone don’t worry.
Sorry so slow but I m on my phone
Come on, let's do it this way!
Thank you so much for your help, and this weekend then!
Good morning
So what made your day so bad today?
Did you have time to take lunch?
The day had begun.
Yes, I was able to have lunch.
In the garage.
This morning my car broke down.
Between two dates
Oh no poor you.
And it was pouring with rain today too.
I hope you didn't get wet.
As you're now home, I'm assuming that you managed to get the car fixed?
No, I had to walk home.
A real nightmare.
How much is it going to cost to get the car fixed?
Not very expensive, but you have to order the spare.
About 200 euros.
Have you got 200 euros?
We could use the holiday money we've put by?
If only that
Running to catch the bus, I twisted my ankle.
I thought it was looking a bit swollen.
You need to get some ice on it.
I wanted to call a cab.
And when he saw that I was soaking wet, he wouldn't let me in.
Then it pissed me off.
How terrible.
I'm sorry you've had such a bad day.
I started screaming at him.
What did he say then?
So it was better.
Insults.
Tomorrow I can drive you to work if your ankle is feeling up to it.
Did you get all the ingredients for salmon for dough and beef bourguignon?
what are you talking about?!
I'm head chef!
You were meant to get the ingredients.
please don't tell me you forgot to go shopping
what are we going to serve our customers?
our hungry, hungry customers!
But you told me you'd go to the market this morning!
Don't we have the ingredients?
the market was so i could meet up with our wholesalers to talk about the wedding we're catering at this saturday
anyway, we are clearly in a massive pickle here
i guess we'll just have to use leftovers from yesterday and hope they don't notice anything wrong
We got five hours till tonight's dinner.
I can go to the super market and see what they got.
I'm sorry, I misunderstood...
any complaints and the customer eats for free
well you better hurry then because we have prep to do
and bully beef takes more than five hours
I'm off and I'll be back with what I find!
honestly, sometimes i wonder where you kids get your training nowadays
wait, before you go, here is a list of everything we need for tonight's service
I'm back!
I found a salmon and beef cheeks.
Is that all right?
wow!
that was fast
i guess it will have to do
I ran.
I did a lot of running in high school.
i certianly hope you're not going to be cooking the beef and salmon together
I'm starting the dough sauce.
That would be weird... you think it could be good?
dough sauce?!
what in the lord's name is that?
If it's not in Jamie Oliver's latest recipe book, i'm not making it
Ah, yes, we could make a salmon in crust, that's true!
It would go faster and it's still chic!
right, get to work
this food won't cook itself
Yeah, we're gonna make it!
your enthusiasm sickens me
Hi, planning this party will be fun.
What kind of party do you think it should be?
It's for your birthday.
What would you like?
I was thinking along the lines of a them maybe?
sorry, I meant 'theme'
1980's theme would be good
We could get everyone to dress up in 1980's clothes
Oh yeah, the '80s, that's a great idea!
We'd have to find all the canisters we were listening to back then.
I should still have tapes somewhere...
Have you heard of Spotify?
It's an online music app that has just about any music from any era
It's not stupid.
There must be playlists... I can pick up some music tonight.
I think Marc's using a lot of Spotify.
He loves tubes from the '80s and' 90s.
Maybe he's got playlists he wrote himself.
I'll ask him!
Great, thank you.
Foodwise, we could have a selection of food - cold meat, curries, bread and cheese
and of course a cake!
I'm not sure there was a particular type of food for the 1980s?
Of course a cake!
It's essential!
I can make one if you want.
I love baking.
We could bake a cake with glitter frosting, it'll be 80-year-olds!
By the way, we're gonna have to dance!
I'm up for dancing disco style!
Talking of glitter, we could get a glitter ball
and thank you for offering to bake a cake, I'm sure it will look wonderful
Oh, yeah.
I remember that at the time we made one with polystyrene and broken mirrors.
We could do a little workshop on Sunday morning, and then everything will be ready for the party on Saturday.
That's a good plan!
Oh, no, it's happening again!
i know!
that's the fifth time this month!
i wonder why hasn't it been properly fixed yet.
I'm paying a fortune for the maintenance of these machines!
I'm surrounded by incompetents
I mean, I'm not saying that for you...
phew!
i was worried there for a second.
do you think we should call for help?
or will someone notice soon enough?
Did you know who you're talking to?
My absence will soon notice.
But we're going to press the S.O.S. button.
I hope the surgery will be quick, I'm claustrophobic.
you're exactly right.
of course people will notice you're missing.
5 seconds without being shouted at and they will start wondering why the open space is so calm and pleasant all of a sudden
Hey, be polite!
If you continue this tone, it will go wrong for you.
i'm so scared.
i'm quivering in my boots.
actually, you know what?
i don't care
in fact, i've been waiting years for the perfect opportunity to tell you exactly how i feel about working here
and working for you, in particular
Go on, develop...
you go on and on about being "more productive" and "more efficient"
and i hear you mention the word "agile" one more time i swear my blood will boil
you never give us enough time to complete any of the numerous tasks you give us and your constant badgering only makes us less efficient and less productive
if you just trusted all of us to do uor jobs we would be so much more effective
and so much happier to boot.
typo: if you just trusted all of us to do our jobs we would be so much more effective
chill out.
you hired us to do a job
Stop right there!
so let us do it
Listen to me:
i'm listening
As soon as this damn elevator lifts again, you're gonna see the Director of Human Resources.
You'll hand him your resignation.
Then you'll pack your boxes and leave tonight.
I never want to see you in my business again.
Never!
i won't do anything of the sort.
if you want me out of here, you're going to have to fire me.
and i will happily have a word with the labour tribunals about all of the unpaid overtime you have ALL of us doing here.
don't forget, i know everything that this company has been doing for the past 10 years: tax evasion, price fixing,...
the list is endless
good luck when that hits the front page of the daily papers
Do you think those berries are edible?
They look delicious!
This is really exciting being lost like this!
You can't eat them!
It could be toxic!
I'm a little scared.
If it gets dark and we can't find our way, I'm gonna cry!
Really?
Are you scared of the dark?
I find it cool.
Like halloween.
Anything could happen!
What if a wolf comes along?
Oh wow?
Do you think that will happen?
I love animals!
Do you not like dogs?
Dogs do, but wolves don't!
Woof woof!
Fine.
I won't eat the berries.
But where should we go then?
We'll figure out where to sleep tonight.
Beneath the stars!
Did you bring anything to make a fire with?
I've got some marshmallows in my bag.
I got matches!
I hope we're not getting cold.
I am a bit actually.
I should have brought a jumper with me.
I thought it was going to be really sunny today, you see.
But at night it will grow.
What will grow?
Well, I'm going to lie down and look at the stars.
No, I meant at night it's colder than during the day.
And tomorrow we're gonna find the way back.
I suppose so.
Or we could be lost here forever.
We could leave a trail like Hansel and Gretel to make sure that we don't get even more lost.
Fair enough.
I'll leave the berries until I'm really hungry.
You're not still scared are you?
Oh, you must be sleeping already...
Where are the onions?
I'm waiting for the onions.
I shouldn't wait!
Inside the basket that is sitting on top of the fridge
I will go and grab them for you
Here are your onions
Are they still raw?
I asked you five minutes ago to chop them up and get them back to the frying pan.
No way!
Chopping them now chef and will get them ready for you.
What is on the next order?
You'll have to learn to obey me and be effective, or I'll find another deputy.
Yes chef
What is next chef?
The rest of the vegetables is ready for serving.
Don't overheat them.
They'll burn.
Did you learn where to cook?
I won't let that happen chef.
They are ready for you now Chef.
On your left!
All right.
You get the sauce, now.
I hope you know how to do that on your own.
Sauce is ready.
Serving now chef.
They have special dietary requirements.
No milk chef.
Have we got a milk-free sauce?
You should have told me earlier.
No, we don't have free sauce!
But we can make a sauce without salt.
Do you have any idea how to make sauce without salt that is good?
Sorry Chef!
Will whip something up now.
Yes chef!
I would not be a good chef if salt was necessary!
That's my girl.
Have you thought about taking bread for the ducks?
Damn.
No, I ate it on the way here.
Have you got anything on you?
I just got a pack of cigarettes.
Do you think it would eat little pieces of tobacco?
Erm, probably not.
I'm a bit worried.
Didn't you say you had pets at home?
Yes, of course.
A cat and two parakeets.
What's that got to do with it?
And what do you feed them?
Tobacco too?
Of course not!
I'm not stupid, they're my animals, I feed them properly!
But they're just ducks.
Well, I see you don't want to try the experiment.
It doesn't matter, we walk in the park?
Ok.
Let's leave the ducks alone.
We could go see what that squirrel's doing over there.
As long as you don't try to feed it.
Don't worry!
It's nice, this park, when it looks good like that.
We should walk around more often, it feels good.
Yeah, it's good to do something other than watching TV.
Get some fresh air and all that.
It's true that we spend too much time watching TV.
We know, but we keep going.
It's a bit stupid.
What do you mean we keep going?
Well, we keep watching TV, even if we know we're spending too much time there.
How long before these first dishes have to be out chef?
5 minutes, sir.
Damn, I blew up the steaks.
You don't need to call me sir.
You're the boss!
Well, hurry up, then.
You have to put more cream in it.
In pasta.
And most importantly, stop poking pills.
Pasta!
i'm not cooking pasta I thought it was the rice dish!
I have to take these pills to calm me down when I'm working with you
At the Bella Donna Mia, we never served rice.
For five generations
Unless there's a war
Have you seen table two?
The couple of British tourists?
Well, I've only worked an a cafe before so I didn't know.
Why is there rice in the cupboard if we never serve it?
Are we expecting a war?
They want Jell-O.
Great idea, I'll change the menu.
Yes I've seen them. They will be a nightmare.
Coarse and rude, can't speak French and expect us to speak English.
And they don't like eating snails.
Jelly - see just what I said.
Ah ha, we've got to make up a recipe for pasta snails jelly.
Where are you on dessert?
Is it coming?
Hold on, I've only just put the water on for the pasta.
The deserts are in the refrigerator.
I will get them out as soon as I can, but I only have two hands.
Water for pasta!
That's why it burns!
I said deserts for fun, I meant desserts!
Best joke ever
How has the Bella Donna Mia cooked pasta then?
For 5 generations?
Not just pizza, too.
Come on, let me finish my shift.
Ciao!
Cheerio!
Hey, let's go and play volleyball?
We've been sunbathing now for a few hours and I'm getting restless.
Mm-hmm.
I'd like to hang out in the sun just a little longer.
Really!
How about we have one game and you can come back and sunbath after?
Well, I don't have too much energy right now...
Besides, you're still the winner, 'cause you're cheating with the points!
That's not true.
When have I cheated?
This morning, the day before yesterday...!
It's okay, it's just that I don't want to do anything...
What about the time when we were playing cards and I went to the loo.
I know you looked at my cards when I was away.
Oh!
You're just jealous because I'm better than you.
Jealous!
You can't be serious.
Okay, I'm going to the bar to get a drink.
Would you like one?
Oh, yeah, that's what I'm talking about.
You're still nice, I like you even though you're a cheater!
Cheeky so and so!
What's it to be... cocktail?
Excuse me?
What cocktail would you like?
Oh, I'll have a mojito, please!
And can you tell the waiter that this time he doesn't con me on the amount of rum?
Yeah, I think he's scamming on the alcohol.
I'll see if he can give us some snacks too.
Okay, great!
I'll take my nap then.
I hope the cocktail will calm you down a little.
I hope it doesn't!
We'll see about that!
Come on, I'm sleeping, and thank you!
Thank you too!
Let's go!
Happy birthday!
Thank you.
Let's get organising
I fancy a gin party
I don't even know what it is.
A gin party?
It's a weird theme.
But it's your birthday, we'll do whatever you want
Maybe you could make a lemon and gin cheesecake for dessert
You are such a good cook and your puddings are always so enjoyed
I have about 10 different gins and we could make a cocktail menu
I even have a yellow Canadian gin!
No problem for dessert.
And the 43 kinds of gin
What were you thinking of?
If I checkout some cocktail recipes and I ll buy alll the mixers, fruits, mint, lemon, lime etc
Now for music?
What do you think?
Oh I do have some non alcoholic gin too for friends that are driving or who do not drink
We ll have plenty of juice but I think it would be a nice change from wine and beer
We can have the main part of the party outside as the weather is so warm
Then I think it's a lot of lemon, but if it's not a problem.
For the music, I've prepared a playlist that I think you're going to love.
For the non-alcoholic, it's very nice to have thought of it.
As for the outside will be fine, I have a barnum in case it starts to rain.
Have you thought about a list of guests?
I drink it often as therwise I would be on the Canadian gin and my poor liver would suffer
Honey, I think your time is already in pain.
Mine too, by the way.
Did you mean umbrella?
Your liver, I'm sorry.
Yeah, you know, those big tents we're going up to shelter during the holidays.
Oh fine, thanks for your help.
See you later
Hello Maria, how are you?
I'm really well, thank you.
I'm enjoying living here.
I told you you'd get used to it!
It was only a matter of time.
What's up?
How do you deal with your days?
I know I was reluctant to leave my house as I had so many happy times there, but at the end of the day it was just bricks and mortar.
Home is where you are.
Yes, you couldn't be alone in that house any more.
You needed company.
I agree, I was lonely.
What about you, are you happy?
So what are you talking about?
Yes, I'm happy.
We talk a lot of politics in here.
We try and put the world to rights.
Do other residents share your opinions?
Ha ha no!
They think I am a bit extreme.
Can you believe that?
What a lot of nonsense.
You!
Extreme!
It's the backwards world.
It must be so difficult to talk calmly.
I know I couldn't.
Oh I just laugh quietly afterwards at them all.
Silly people.
Otherwise, you saw, the sun is back!
How would you like to go out in the park in the next few days?
That would be lovely, thank you.
Do you remember the times when we used to walk in the park when we were young?
Hi!
I just got back.
How was your day?
My day was awful.
The train was late and I got soaking wet.
Then my boss called me in to his office to tell me that I wouldn't be getting a pay rise this year as the business wasn't doing very well.
How was your day?
It was hard!
The customers have been bothering me all the time.
Besides, a child came and insulted me!
I'm on edge.
Oh dear!
that makes two of us
Shall we treat ourselves to something really nice for dinner to make up for such a bad day?
Maybe we could go out to eat, although I should be thinking about saving money if I'm not going to get a pay rise?
Yeah, we can go out for lunch.
But if the money's a problem, then why are we having a home-cooked dinner.
I'm proposing a duck dash.
Hmmmm!
What's a duck dash?
Do you mean dish?
Yeah, I'm talking about the duck-based dish.
It's very good.
And we can enjoy a wine with wine.
I do like duck, particularly with pommes dauphinois.
Do you fancy cooking the duck and I'll cook the potatoes.
A nice bottle of red wine sounds good.
What do you suggest?
It's perfect!
But since the day was intense for both of us, what do you think of preparing for a good dessert too?
It soothes the spirit and warms the heart.
I could make my specialty, a frangipan and apple tart.
It tastes better with double cream.
I love frangipane!
It's so good!
Okay, to do this.
On my side, I'm gonna cook a great chocolate fudge!
We can associate it with ice cream or ice cream.
Well, let's not forget to do a bit of sports in the week to eliminate all this.
Great.
We have a deal...bon appetite!
Bon appétit, of course!
Louise, how many more minutes before the desserts for table four will be ready?
Uh... actually, I have a problem, boss...
I didn't know how to tell you... but I think I burned the cream:
Burned the cream?
Why were you cooking cream?
I did what you asked for, boss, but since I was also busy making the entrance for table six, I didn't pay attention to the time and I let the cream burn...
I think it's time to start over, or they say it's a new pre-guarantee recipe?
Yes start again.
That's the second mistake you've made today and you were late for work.
Is there something bothering you?
Yes, it's not too good right now... my dog is sick, but Mother beats me, plus I have roaches in my apartment!
But it's all right, I'll do the dessert, and I promise I'll be on time and I'll be careful!
You can count on me, boss!
Ok.
Have another go with the dessert.
And perhaps you can take some of the waste food for your dog.
You're very kind, boss.
But, you know, sugar isn't very good for dogs.
He might get even sicker!
And maybe get a ice- pack for your swollen eye where your mother must have hit you.
Oh, can I get a piece of meat instead?
It's perfect for black eyes.
Yes they used to put meat on swollen heads in the comics.
Try a piece of our best steak.
And take the meat tenderiser he with you.
It could be useful to beat your mother back.
It's true that I only saw it in comics, but it must be true!
You want me to bat my mother?
Or is it a technique for her to come and buy us some meat?
More customers would be great.
Perhaps you could do a comedy turn with that steak in?
perhaps a cabbage leaf on top of you
...steak over your eye.
Perhaps you could put a cabbage leaf on top of your head?
Uh, all right, if you want!
But if you give me a clown job, you're gonna have to recruit another cook!
Sorry sent message by mistake - complete garbage!
I think I'm the one who needs to quit!
Bye!
Good luck, boss!
It's starting to look like we're not moving.
What do you think?
Should we call?
Call who?
The lift engineer or the receptionist?
I think we'd get a quicker response from our people in reception.
Or we could just press the alarm button.
Yeah, I was thinking about the alarm button.
I don't have the number of anyone who can help us.
Besides, there's no water.
Come on, I'll press.
Good.
Actually, there is a number on the bottom of the grille.
Damn, I've haven't got any reception.
What about your phone?
No better.
All we have to do now is wait.
I had a meeting with Dubois at 2: 00, and I hate being late!
And you?
You were in the sixth grade, too?
Was this the meeting that Cheryl set up to discuss the new holiday rotas?
I think I was supposed to be attending, too, except it doesn't appear on my schedule.
I hate being late, too, but I guess there's nothing we can do but sit tight.
Yeah, this meeting here, it's gonna be hard to set up, and even more if we're not there, neither...
Well, never mind, it's not like we could be a part of this.
Did you get my memo about construction delays?
Construction delays, what's that all about?
I thought we were going to be talking about holiday rotas.
Usually I work over Christmas because I live in London close to the office, but this year I'd like the time off for a change.
Do you live in town or do your family live in another part of the country?
Hi, I'd like something strong, please.
I have to get over my emotions!
Whisky?
Have you had a bad day?
Single malt?
Yes, whiskey, perfect.
I just witnessed an accident.
A car hit a cyclist.
I had to call the fire department, and it was very impressive.
Oh god, how is the cyclist?
Do you know?
Cycling is so tricky, especially in a city
The car ran over his leg, he bled a lot.
London has so few cycle lanes I would not cycle myself
But his prognosis is not hired.
Yes, it's true that bike rides are very vulnerable in the city!
Let us hope he will be ok, long term
It is pathetic how little the government and the local councils take cycling into consideration when they are planning
Lorries can be lethal weapons especially
Yeah, that's too bad.
There should be more bike leads.
That would give you the same time to reduce pollution.
I presume you mean lanes
Work places also need to provide showers and changing rooms
I remember working next to this man who was very proud of cycling 15 miles into work
Unfortunately he stank of body odour all day!!
Yeah, you're right.
Or we should start smoking people at the entrance to their place of employment.
I am not sure what you mean but I think there could be the BO police at the entrance!!
Do you cycle?
Yeah, I used to do a lot of things, but after the accident I just saw, I'm not sure I'm gonna make it back so soon!
I don't blame you.
You really must be shaken up
Do you want another whisky?
Yes, please.
Thank you.
I'm really happy tonight, I'm throwing a party at my house!
I know it's a little late for the organization, but... it's my birthday!
There is lots to organise though
I'm glad you could make it.
Have you thought if you want a theme?
Yes, as I do at the last minute, everything is done!
Theme?
No, not yet, but it's a good idea!
Sorry I thought we were organising it, are you happy for it to be another night?
How about black and white as a theme
Or maybe your favourite colour?
Black and white?
That's a good idea!
So shall we do some invitations just in black and white?
And I can get some decorations, balloons and things
But it's perfect!
Could you come over from 14 hours to help me set it up!
The party will be tonight, but, if you're available, it might be nice to prepare together because you have a lot of good ideas!
Who has been invited?
Did you ask that good looking professor?
Right now, you're the first person I've been in contact with.
I didn't dare ask him...
Oh you had better get on and get some handsome men invited then!
Have you got some music that will be suitable?
Go on, he can only say he is busy
It can't hurt
Okay.
I'll ask him.
At worst, he'll tell me he's not available...
It ll be fun anyway
Yes!
I'm counting on it.
Shall I leave you get inviting people and I can sort out some decorations and music
Okay.
We do this, I contact my other friends, and I let you make the decorations in black and white!
I ll see you a bit later and we can sort out the food etc when I get there
Sir, can I ask you a question, please?
Yes, please do.
I don't understand why I only got 12 / 20 in control.
I think it deserves a lot more points than that.
Why do you think you deserve more?
Because I wrote 14 pages, and I put a lot of quotes out.
I had learned a lot of quotes, and I put the best part in my copy.
Not all of your quotes were entirely relevant I'm afraid.
Referencing quotes is useful but they need to relate to the question at hand.
I understand that, but still, 12 / 20 for 14 pages, I don't think it's enough.
Otherwise, next time I'll draw two pages, like Martin, who got 15.
That's not fair.
It's your pet!
He always gets better grades than I do, even if he writes anything.
Well, he is in my golf club!
He plays golf with you?
But that's not fair!
You know him personally, so you favor him.
I think I'll talk to the principal about it.
The principal is also a member!
There must be other teachers who don't play golf.
I can't imagine Mrs. Smith playing golf.
Ah, Mrs Smith, we've been dating for nearly a year now.
Martin introduced us.
But she must be 20 years older than you.
Can I quote you on that?
Playing golf and being mean to students keeps me looking young.
Really we're about the same age.
Really?
I wouldn't have thought.
I thought he'd be younger...
Well, don't you want to raise my tab a bit, even if I don't play golf?
Sorry, no.
If only you had done 15 pages....
It's not fair!
Your reputation isn't going to improve.
C'est la vie
All right.
Goodbye, sir.
Bye
So, the idea is, if you get the duck's body it's 5 points and it's 10 for the head!
Here, take some breadcrumbs.
Are you offering me a game?
In which, according to where I touch the duck, can I earn more or less points?
Do I understand?
Of course!
Don't you know it?
No, it's the first time in my life I've played this game!
After that, I've been living in Iceland for years now.
And there are no ducks, more sheep, and horses...
You could play with horses, but you risk getting charged at!
It works a lot better with ducks, because they don't fight back as much!
And they like being fed anyway.
So it's win win!
Indeed!
Anyway, they'll rush on the bread!
Oh, have you seen... there are also ducklings...
They're really cute...
I love watching them bobbing about in the water! 20 points for a duckling!
Or is that too cruel?
Oh no, they're too cute...
We can start thinking about changing the rules.
If we can draw three steps to one piece of bread in the water, then we get 20 points.
I don't really understand your new rule.
What do you mean by "draw three steps to one piece of bread in the water"?
I misspoke
The idea is to make it three ducklings.
On one piece of bread
You really think it's possible to get three ducklings with one piece of bread?
They'd need to be very close together...
That's why the score is high...
20 points
True...
And that may be very difficult to realize.
Well, let's give it a go then!
You go first!
Hello, ma'am.
Sit here.
Thank you.
I am hopeful that you can help me.
How can I help you?
I have been feeling very sad lately.
Has anything special happened to you lately?
A disappointment, a failure?
Or nothing special, just the routine that doesn't satisfy you?
No, not really.
I just don't enjoy all the things I used to like doing.
What would you like to do?
I would like to play sport but I don't seem to have any energy.
Are you eating enough?
Probably not.
I tend to snack on things like crisps and biscuits which I know are not very good for me.
Food can have a very important effect on how you feel, you know.
What should I do?
Maybe you should see a diet doctor to help you organize your food.
I'm sure it would help to restore energy and to what you feel better.
What sport would you like to practice?
I would like to play football.
Is it a sport you've practiced in the past?
I have played a little in the past.
Can you recommend a good diet doctor please?
Yes, of course.
Right across the street there's Dr. Jekyll's office, he's an excellent diet doctor.
And besides, he's a very good friend of mine.
Am I talking with Mr Hyde?
No, not at all.
But we often make a joke...
But you can do it to him, he's used to it.
He has a good sense of humor!
That is so funny.
You have cheered me up no end.
I think this consultation has been worth every penny.
I'm glad.
But, actually, we're gonna have to stop there.
It's time for my next patient.
I wish you a very good day.
And you will give me news of your progress on the health plan.
See you!
Ok thank you.
Goodbye Mr Hyde.
I'm sorry doctor, I had to see you at such short notice.
I think I'm losing my mind!
What's going on?
Well, I called my mother my wife this morning, and then put my shoes in the oven!
What made you want to put your shoes in the oven?
Were those sports shoes or city shoes?
They were sports shoes when they went into the oven but came out as lumps of coal.
I don't know why I did it.
My feeling is these pills that you have given me are too strong.
Maybe the pills are strong.
How long has it been since you started taking them?
I agree.
And it's been about a month now.
I've been quite depressed, and they affect my memory badly and make me very sleepy.
Well, we can expect side effects on sleep or memory indeed, but cooking her shoes is something else.
Because there's either there's an acute perception problem (you take your shoes for a piece of cake, or you have a lot of casualties, or you really wanted to burn your shoes.
What did you and your mother talk about?
Well, it's difficult to talk to my Mum as she's 96 and virtually deaf.
It gets confusing.
She calls me by my brother's name, and I have to shout and keep repeating myself.
Perhaps I just need a good holiday?
If you're going to a party, I wouldn't advise you to cook.
You go out with friends a lot lately?
No, I've been a bit of a hermit, and haven't felt sociable or confident around people.
Maybe if I go a nice quiet vacation abroad, good weather and a nice book to read, I'll come back feeling refreshed.
What do you think?
Do you play sports?
Yes, I think i mentioned to you that I played a lot of rugby and that was where I got the really heavy head knock which was the start of my troubles.
Yes, I see.
I think putting shoes in the oven indicates strong emotions that can't express itself otherwise.
So I would advise you: A regular athletic practice (, for instance, running), locking your oven and eating cold meals to avoid a sinister in your building, and put you in the theater.
In parallel, we cut down half the pills.
It's been a long time since we've had to hit the road, I feel like we're lost...
You got the map?
No, I thought you had it
Wait, I'll look in my bag.
OK.
I'm hungry too.
Do you have anything left to eat?
Well, I can't find the map...
But there's still chocolate, you want some?
Yes please.
I'm not sure what we can do without the map.
Maybe find a river.
Here!
He's good, isn't he?
Yeah, we can try to go down that way.
It should allow us to join the river, and the river runs towards the village.
On the other hand, it's more of a journey...
That chocolate is really nice
And it's late, the sun's starting to turn down.
We have to hurry!
ok - you lead the way.
I'm hopeless when it comes to directions.
Listen, can you hear that noise?
It's scary.
As soon as we get out of the way, we'll go into wild beasts territory.
Besides, with the sun setting, it's the perfect time to run into a wolf or a bear!
We really need to get back.
By the river it'll be safer.
You're teasing me
Aren't you?
I'd rather not think about it.
Careful, there's roots everywhere, so it wouldn't take one of us to get hurt!
I know, I haven't got the best shoes on for this kind of terrain
Ah, I feel like you can see the river below.
We're saved!
Well done for getting us back
Thank you!
Good morning Mr Smith, how are you feeling this morning?
Great!
I ate three frogs and two snails.
Was that for breakfast?
Did you enjoy them?
No, for lunch.
But it's the butter that goes with which is good;
And on your side?
Very well, thank you.
Now, tell me, why have you come to see me this afternoon?
I feel like I'm seeing double.
When I see green, I see red too.
Is it serious, Doctor?
I see!
Do you see green and red together all the time?
Or just at certain times?
If so, when?
It's punctual but intense.
When I look at a green pepper, it becomes a red pepper.
Can you please explain what you mean by 'punctual'?
That's confusing.
It's only from time to time.
Sometimes.
But these colors of color can last several hours.
And it's very embarrassing because I'm in charge of the traffic lights.
Do you think this is from my childhood?
Thank you for making it clear when you see double.
How old were you when you started seeing red and green together?
Is there a history of this problem in your family?
I've been seeing double for five years.
I don't know any similar problems in my family.
Except maybe my great grandfather, but he drank a lot.
Thank you, Mr Smith.
Having reviewed what you have told me, I think this is something for an optician not a psychiatrist.
Is there anything else you wish to ask me?
Thank you for your advice.
Yes, I'm going to change doctors.
We appear to have stopped moving.
I don't pay you to just stand there.
DO something.
You're absolutely right, I'll try to call the front desk.
They should be able to help us out.
There is no TRY.
I feel like there's no signal here.
I'm not gonna be able to make a phone call.
Does this elevator have an emergency call system?
Open that.
It looks like some kind of telephone box on the wall.
Okay, I'll see if that's right.
Maybe you could look at your cell phone.
We may not have the same operator.
Well, indeed, this big red button looks promising.
Do you agree that I should press it?
You ask a lot of questions.
I'll take that as a yes.
It's ringing, someone might be able to talk to us.
That's good.
I'm impressed.
Ah, it stopped.
What stopped?
Are you sure this elevator is properly maintained?
The ringing stopped, and I don't think anyone's gonna answer us.
Are you blaming me for this?
I wouldn't dare accuse you of anything.
You're not responsible for fixing that elevator!
Well, in a way, yes.
But that's not what I meant
I mean, you know.
Stop babbling.
You're starting to annoy me now.
Did you see if your phone picked up the network?
It's getting hot in here.
I don't carry a phone.
I have an assistant to do that.
Well, we're gonna have to wait for someone to figure out that the elevator is out of order, and bring someone in.
It's good here to enjoy the sun!
It's good to get some rest.
yeah, but how about we go and enjoy the sun elsewhere?
Okay, but I'd like to rest for a few more minutes.
Where would you like to go next?
i want to go and check out the amazing walking tracks they have nearby.
The one's that cut through the jungle.
i hear you can even get to see some beautiful birds if you're lucky.
Great!
And you think we can run into other animals?
i hope so.
I hear the wildlife here is very rich.
from what the guide told me yesterdat when we were visiting the temple, there are lions and tigers in the area
How was the temple tour yesterday?
I haven't seen any of them.
But I can't wait to find out.
It's so interesting.
well you would know if you hadn't stayed here by the poolside getting a nice melanoma, wouldn't you?
Oh, that's a little uncalled for what you're telling me!
It's just that I'm very tired and stressed out about work, I needed to blow off some steam.
sorry, it's just that whenever we go on holidays all you want to do is sit by the pool
fair enough
i get that you're tired from work.
How about we say that tomorrow we go on an excursion to the street markets and then we can eat somewhere in town.
Does that sound good?
Yes, with pleasure!
I'd love to.
awesome.
And you're right.
in which case today you can show me how to do nothing but sit by the pool and soak up the sun.
It works!
Let's stay here by the pool, then.
But we can also swim a little
Half an hour in the sun, the i'll race you to the pool bar to get some cocktails.
last one there has to pay
This program suits me
And I hope I won't be the last.
with only $10 left in you bank account, i hope so for you too
Oh no!
This is the third time the lift has broken in the last two weeks.
I thought I asked you to speak to maintenance about it?
I did.
I immediately contacted maintenance when you told me about it.
They've not been good lately.
I know that there is someone new in the department.
Perhaps he is not up to it?
Anyway what do you suggest we do?
As soon as we get out of the elevator, I'm gonna get in touch with them.
The idea is to see what was done, and to understand why the elevator broke down again.
I've heard of a young intern...
If he's the one they sent to repair it, it might be a lead to figure out why the elevator broke down again...
That's great.
When you get the story I will make an appointment to see the Head of Maintenance.
That is, if we get this thing moving and can get out.
Last time I tried my phone but there is no signal in this metal box and the alarm button didn't work.
Let's try the alarm button.
Maybe it's fixed.
OK, I've pressed it and there is no sound.Shall we try shouting?
You've got a good strong voice.
You're a singer aren't you?
Yes.
But, I'm not sure that's enough...
However, I'm picking up a little bit.
I'm trying to text the co-worker at the desk.
Let's hope that works.
I think i can hear someone calling from above us.
I think they know its stuck and will start winching it down to the floor below soon.
Are you feeling OK?
It's getting hot in here and we probably have another 15 minutes to wait.
I've got some water if you want.
It is very hot...
And then I took the elevator to eat;
I hope we can get out quickly!
I can't help you with food.
I've only got this half-eaten cheese sandwich in my hand.
Oh!
dropped it when the lift jerked.
I think we are on the way out!
thank goodness for that.
Can you make your enquiries into the maintenance of the lifts straight away?
No problem.
I'll contact the team immediately.
Thanks.
I will see you later and you can tell me what you've found.
Can you just leave work at work?
You are moaning an awful lot
Excuse me?
Oh, right.
I had a really bad day.
So you keep saying.
Would it not be better if we think about something positive and fun?
Or do you want to tell me about it for a limited amount of time?
It's all right.
I was late for work because of the strikes.
And there was this important meeting
What could you do?
Was your boss very cross?
He went off in a quarter-hour wait.
And I was the one who presented
The results of the year
So?
Was it really so bad?
You got your moment in the limelight
Well, since I didn't have a hearing
The meeting was canceled.
I think we should just open a nice bottle of red wine and you should forget about work
They thought I'd make myself pale.
And I had to explain the rest of the day.
I wouldn't get that promotion.
Being late was unavoidable so I think you should just open the wine
There is no point being grumpy at home
I had a simple objective, and I'm not gonna be able to fix the shot.
That's too bad.
All this work for nothing.
Where's the corkscrew?
Just in the right hand drawer, I ll get the glasses
Hurry up
Cheers
Could you please put that gum in the bin
Hello, ma'am.
Yes, of course.
I couldn't find any on the way.
I meant spit out your chewing gum, you know the school rules
Then sit down quickly and we will look at your homework
I didn't find a bin on the way.
Well, it's done now.
So how did you find your maths homework?
Not easy, but I think I did it.
You seem to have had difficulty with the equations
The instructions weren't clear.
What's going to happen on the exam?
If you had concentrated you would have found the instructions clear.
You should put Facebook and any other diverting social media sites away and only get on to them when you finish your homework
I'm not going on Facebook.
But I don't work much on weekends.
It's a principle.
But you're lucky I was able to do my homework last Thursday.
Well I think your principles are flawed
After school night
Really?
But it's fun, I have the same principles as the whole class
I am not lucky, do you think I like to spend my time marking, do you think it is for my benefit?
Oh, but I'm learning a lot.
Even though I'm getting up late.
You are a clever boy but you are really not making the most of your opportunities
Talking back to me now is a prime example
That's true.
Do you go to bed late?
But the schedule isn't practical.
I missed a lot of your classes' cause it was nap time.
You are not a toddler!!
How do you think we can resolve this?
I have principles, I told you
I propose to guarantee good grades this year and I'll make an effort
Are you parents encouraging?
And supportive ?
Anyway, the equations are useless.
You know, I really liked the lecture on fluid mechanics.
Oh, I'm sorry, I was wrong with you.
Just go away and think about your priorities and what you want to achieve, and get to bed early!!
Thank you, ma'am, can I sign the presence sheet first?
Yes, goodbye
You're late again.What is your excuse today?
I missed my bus today.
There are strikes right now.
Besides, you were late yesterday, too.
Yes, I had forgotton about the strikes.
I came in by car today to avoid the buses.
Anyway, how did you do with your homework last night?
You were right to take the car.
The bus is too long.
It's not long to the exam now and I am, hoping that you get a really good result.
You deserve it.
Has class started?
I did my homework without problem yesterday.
Okay, do you have an exam sheet and copies?
I forgot about my school business.
Actually you are the only one who has managed to get to school so far.
I suppose that everyone else is having problems with transport.
Yes, my comrades are blocked.
I do have an old examination paper.
Perhaps we should use time together going through that?
What do you want to do today if we're alone?
Do you know if the professor of physics is here today?
Well, it is a great chance to havve a discussion about any aspects of your geography revision.
What do you think?
I haven't seen the physics teacher.
Is she expecting to see you?
All right.
I like cards.
What credit cards do you want us to work on?
What are cards?
Maps of every country, every continent in geography.
Thank you.
It's stupid to be lost when we have a good card!
Why did you give it to that leprechauns earlier?
You know full well why!
It was the only way to get them to give us back our food.
And I thought they looked cute...
Hmm.
How about the presents they gave us?
Have you opened yours yet?
With the map we would have quickly found the quickest way to the best restaurant in the area.
Oh no!
Why were we so naive?
Wait... what did they give me?
A fork?
They're taunting us!
No, I haven't opened it yet, I'm suspicious because of the rabbit-skin gift-skin gift and that particular smell that he walks away...
Let me have a look... You mean that smell's coming from your present?
Oh, maybe I have the extra fork!
Patience...
This is a good bill!
What's a good bill?
It means it was well manufactured.
Could it be that it has magic powers?
Unfortunately, mine's just a normal fork.
And bent at that.
And bent over that?
What does that mean?
They even managed to bend my fork.
It's not even straight.
To eat camembert we use the fork handle, it gets better.
For the magic powers of this cheese Norman, how do you know?
I know you're talking about cheese, but I have no idea what you're talking about.
We could just phone for a taxi?
I suggest we eat the cheese with the fork handle, which makes it bad that it's twisted.
But by the way, I don't know how to provoke her magical powers.
Do you have a network to call the cab or one of our husbands?
Yes!
It's ringing....
Oh, that's cool 'cause my husband's a troll, he breaks all his phones!
Yes!
He's coming to get us now.
We're safe!
I'm quite glad it's mine coming and not yours because I've had enough of fairytale creatures today!
Excuse me, do you hear that noise?
It's weird, isn't it?
Yes, it is weird, it sounds like the engine is failing, I can also hear a lady screaming for help
The engine?
But there's more than one, right?
I don't know anything about airplanes, but I'm terrified every time I fly.
I'm sorry to bother you with this, but I'm really scared.
There is another engine, but I think that I can hear that failing now as well
I don't want to scare you but I think we may be about to plummet to our death
Oh, my God, that's horrible what you're talking about.
You really think so?
Or are you just saying that to make fun of me?
I'm gonna turn my phone back on to send messages to my whole family, tell them I love them, and I'm about to die.
At least it'll probably be instant, no pain, right?
Do you believe in god?
Shall we pray together or have a large drink?
I'm like most people, I don't believe in God except five minutes from the end.
But drinking is probably a good idea.
But no one's gonna serve us if we're crashing.
Let's help ourselves to the alcohol tray, would you care for some red wine?
If we are going to die we may as we
ll
If we survive I'm going to make a complaint to the airline
But you know we don't have a chance, right?
We're gonna crash in the middle of the ocean.
We'll be blown to smithereens, several miles underwater.
We'll talk about our crash in the newspapers.
There is no ocean below us, only Pakistan
You know, from where we fall, it doesn't make much difference.
We did have a chance if we crashed into the ocean, oh what is this, I think I have a parachute in my rucksack
Hug me close and we can land safely together
A parachute?
But why are you walking around with a parachute on you?
Are you sure?
Can it carry two people?
But, wait!
We're gonna land in Pakistan in the middle of tribal areas full of terrorists!
Now isn't the time for such questions, would you like to avoid a horrible death or not?
And frankly, do you think they'll open the plane doors and let us jump without stealing your chute?
Let me check the parachute to see if it is capable to hold two people
Besides, I'm sure there are people who deserve more than me not to die.
Can you feel that?
What?
The strong vibrations
Yes, I feel very good.
It's terrifying.
Oh dear the emergency exits have blown off
Go, take two young children with you, jump, I stay here.
The only thing I'm asking you to do is keep the bottle of red.
Quickly Tristan take hold of my arm, I will assemble my parachute
Forget about the children it is too late for them
Grab the bottle of red in your other hand
Okay, you convinced me.
If we survive maybe we can for a curry in Islamabad
Come on, let's jump, and celebrate our survival with this wonderful Bordeaux, nice and warm in Tora Bora's cave!
Absolutely, I love curry!
Good morning, sir.
How are you tonight?
I came with these tomatoes that I found at the market this morning, I thought it might inspire something beautiful and good.
They're different sizes, colors and flavor.
I'm fine.
Could you start chopping the vegetables please.
Yeah, no problem.
I'll start with the fennel, it takes longer.
What's the entrance and the specials tonight, boss?
That's fine.
Please remember to clear away after you have finished.
Smoked salmon with creme fraiche and cods roe is the starter.
That should be good.
What about the special?
There's the fennel.
I'll go to the carrots.
Guinea fowl with a ballotine of leg, madeira jus, baby leeks, fondant potato and summer truffle.
Excellent.
It makes me hungry!
I can peel the potatoes.
For the truffle, you thought you'd put in thin slices or just use the truffle oil?
Use some shavings please.
Could you also start to make the base for the jus?
Yes, sir, no problem.
But you're sure there's still some Madeira?
I can't find it!
Thank you.
Yes you should find the madeira in the right hand cupboard.
Oh, sorry.
I don't know the location of all the ingredients yet...
And I believe this is the first time we've used the Madeira.
You will have to get to know the kitchen better or you will slow us all down.
get a grip!
Yes, sorry.
Here we go.
In parallel I'll start preparing three pintades.
Don't worry, but make sure you know what's what tomorrow,
Yes, sir.
Oh, I think the first guests are coming.
It's early!
Carry on -I have to go now.
Hi, I'm sorry my homework is late.
I've really struggled to understand what it is I have to do.
Well, that's okay.
We're going back to work together.
Can you explain what you don't understand?
I've been asked to write an essay on politics but I don't know where to start.
Are we talking about British or French politics?
If it's not specific in the statement of the subject, then it's up to you to define it.
Either way, to draft your essay, you have to start by asking about it, explain and define the field.
But there are so many options to choose from. It's like how long is a piece of string...
So if I choose French politics where's the best place to start looking for a topic?
Take an event.
This one may be historic (by example the events of May '68 that we're hearing a lot about right now because it's the 50-year-old.
So the first thing you do is choose.
Ah, ok.
I've just checked that date on Google and there was unrest in France with demonstrations.
That could be interesting.
Do I present the essay as factual or do I take a political view point?
The point of view may be historic or sociological.
What happened back then?
What were the political repercussions or societals?
Or how is that perceived now?
What kind of look do these generations wear on these events?
This is really helping me think through what I need to write, thank you.
How many words is a short essay?
2,000 words
Would it be possible for you to give me an extension to the deadline, say another two weeks?
Okay.
But you must respect that new deadline.
And your essay must be the best you've ever written...
It will be I promise.
Perfect.
Good luck.
I'll send it over to you as soon as it's finished.
Thank you
You're welcome.
Feel free to come back and see if you still have questions or issues.
Good-bye
Good afternoon.
I believe this is the first time we have met.
How may I assist you?
I'm here to see you because I don't understand what's happening to me.
For a few months, sometimes I feel like I hear a voice talking in my head.
A little female voice, almost children, who sometimes comment on what I'm doing.
Often, it's to criticize me.
Is it always the same voice?
Can you recognise anybody you know?
Your sister, your mother, a friend?
No, no one I recognize.
You think I'm going crazy?
Of course not.
Have you had any unusual or unpleasant experiences recently - things that have marked you, that you feel may have been caused by something you did?
No, nothing special, I think.
I have a lot of stress at work, but it's a lot of people...
Yes, I understand.
Are there any women around you, in your work or elsewhere, that you find rather difficult to deal with?
Yes, sir.
She's very competent, but she's pretty hard-core.
She doesn't tolerate mediocrity.
She's very demanding.
Are you referring to a superior at work?
Yes, it is.
I'm talking about the manager of my department.
You think my brain made it into a virtual version of it, and put it in my head even when I'm not at work?
Tell me, are you able to do your work with confidence, or do you feel unable to reach the expected targets?
I work a lot, which allows me, I think, to do my job properly.
I hit my targets.
But it doesn't stop my supervisor at being very hard on me when I'm running a little late or I don't do whatever she wants.
But his reviews are always justified.
I admire him very much.
Maybe she herself is under a lot of stress from higher up and is constantly worried about not meeting her targets.
Do you have colleagues who feel stressed like you?
Is your boss a lady or a man?
I think we're all stressed and at the same time all admire her.
A lady, I think.
I told you, it's a woman.
Very beautiful, too.
Do you feel she herself is under pressure from her directors?
Yes but the translation said "him"!!
Yeah, probably.
Oh, I get it.
I think that in your case the pressure has indeed affected your general emotional state and that you are simply having nightmares about it.
This is very common and nothing to worry about.
Okay.
What do I do?
May I suggest you speak to you colleagues about the situation and exchange experiences?
Do you think I should take a vacation?
All right, I'll try to discuss it discreetly around me.
As you all admire her, perhaps one or two of you could ask to discuss the situation with her, in a positive way, to say how much you appreciate her but that you feel she does not have enough confidence in the team
You don't think she's gonna find that inappropriate walk?
Is she easily available or does she hide behind a closed door?
How formal/informal are conversations with her?
Literally, his door is locked.
But if we have a good reason to talk to her, she's always ready to talk.
We have formal conversations, but almost never informal conversations.
It's a shame, by the way.
But she doesn't drink coffee, and she doesn't smoke, so she stays in her office.
You know, an excellent way to improve work relationships is to organise an informal gathering.
For example, if one of the team-members has something to celebrate - birthday, birth of a child, marriage, whatever - you could suggest a little drinks party at lunchtime
I agree, but it would be more than that to organize.
I'm just an employee among others in this department.
How many are you?
Hmm, I see... but I don't have anything to celebrate.
I'll talk to the colleagues, maybe one of them will have something to celebrate soon.
We're about 50.
Ah yes, that is a lot of people.
And everybody is stressed by this manager?
I'd say yes.
Are there any other managers on her level who are more accessible, people you can talk to easily?
The other managers of his level, we don't know much about them.
They're managers of the other departments.
But I'm going to try to set up your suggestion: Find a good reason for orgniser.
I'm sorry.
But I'm going to try to set up your suggestion: Find a good reason for a jar between colleagues, set it up, and invite him!
I do think that could be a solution, or at least a step in the right direction.
Yes, thank you very much for your advice.
Meanwhile, you personally, do clearly not have a problem with your brain, as you say.
Thank you.
Basically you are under stress, which happens to many people theses days.
As you suggested, a few days' break could help you recover untroubled sleep.
I'll try to put a few days off, then.
I'm sure it'll be better soon.
Please also respect a few well-known rules for easy sleep such as no computer or smartphone just before going to be, nor television.
sorry - just before going to bed
Yeah, I'm gonna do that, too.
And chamomile tea before bed!
Sometimes we laugh at the grandmothers who drink chamomile, but I'll tell you one thing, I like it!
I was going to suggest that too!
Now, I think I've got everything we need to solve this problem!
Thank you!
I am sure we will not need to meet again for a long time, if ever, but please do not hesitate to come back to me if your problems persist
I'm glad I could help.
Noted, thank you again.
Enjoy the rest of the day, Doctor.
Unless you have anything else you would like to mention, I wish you a pleasant continuation, and I hope you are making the most of the bank holidays this week to change your ideas and go for walks in the sunshine!
All right!
Good idea!
See you.
You too, Arthur.
Goodbye
cut those potatoes into proper english chips, now
not those horrible french fries!
Okay, Chief!
How about a cube or a long one?
Do you want beets with them, too?
for goodness sake, english, I said don't you understand anything
long ones of course
no, what are beets?
Maybe with some basil then?
Beets are good, but it might give you a sweet taste.
we are not preparing an italian meal, this will be a proper english meal
Maybe some more cheese?
Okay for the English meal.
How big for the French fries?
although in england they do grow beetroots, if that is what you mean they would traditionally be boiled and served with vinegar
I ll just cut a couple and show you
Yes, we can add olive oil with beets.
It's getting married, I think.
Don't you think?
there
no I dont
Okay, perfect.
I need to see to do the right thing.
just get on and dont talk so much
please could you just sear the beef in a pan and put it on to slow roast
What do you want with it?
How hot is the roast?
Just sear it until its brown and caramalised then put in a casserole with carrots, celery, some seasoning and cover with stock
now tell me how long have you been an apprentice chef?
It's been ten years.
Okay for the planning.
Can I add some celery, too?
I said celery, can't you listen
And how long have you been in charge?
Oh, yeah.
i suggest you listen more and talk less, I have to go now
Ma'am, are we going to be in control soon?
What would you like to be in control of?
A control on the last chapter.
I'd like to know how much time I have left to study.
We will have an exam, if that is what you mean, next week on Thursday
We will cover all the material up to next Tuesday, so start studying soon!
Okay, if I have any questions, could I email them to you?
Of course!
But I will only answer emails during working hours, so please don't send them late on Wednesday evening.
Thank you, ma'am.
So I took my book and my vital hues... is that gonna do it?
your vital hues?
what is that meant to be?
and how is YOUR book going to help me calm down?!
It's not you, I'm the one who's scared of flying, okay?
And I'm talking about essential oils.
brilliant!
we're both scared of flying then.
well this is going to be a whole barrel of laughs, isn't it!
and since when have essential oils helped anyone?!
typical hippy!
A barrel of laughs...
yeah!
a hoot!
a riot!
a whole lot of fun!
In the meantime it stinks all over the plane, my eucalyptus tree.
why did you bring a tree onto the plane?!
how did you get that through security?
And in case of accidents we're supposed to do what?
Like, keep your arms inside?
well if we're in an accident you won't have any arms left to keep inside!
you won't even have a head!
There will be no more inside!!
oh god!
why did i let you convince me to take this bloody plane
it's all your fault
We have to go to your mother-in-law.
so it's all her fault then!
i knew it!
I always knew she wanted us dead
oh god!
oh god!
oh god!
i'm going to be sick!
And the pilot, he's not suicidal, I hope.
I don't want to see the Alps too close...
wuick!
hand me the paper bag.
i think i'm going to heave!
why did you have to mention the pilot!
of course he's depressive!
he is probably about to be laid off by head office!
For the plane moving like that?
It's way too heavy in there, and the hotels don't seem very comfortable.
It's obvious they're trying to keep their cool.
They're hiding something, I'm sure!
