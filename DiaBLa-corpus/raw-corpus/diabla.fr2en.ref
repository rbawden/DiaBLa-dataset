You’re right there.
Let’s wait and see if something happens quickly.
The project is late, it’s true.
I don’t know how much it’s your fault, but if we’re stuck in this lift a long time, you could work in here.
You’ve got your computer with you, I see. It’s perfect.
Do you do a lot of sport?
I have no idea which floor your office is on, you know.
There are several hundred employees in this company and I can’t know where everyone’s office is.
Anyway, I always take the lift.
Miraculously it’s never broken down with me in it.
Until today.
Yes, I know I’ve had to renegotiate the contract for a while.
But my timetable is completely full, you know. I never have time to deal with such practical details.
I need to ask Archibald to handle it urgently. 
Well, we’re standing here chatting, but we’re still stuck.
I’m going to press the help button.
Does your phone have any reception?
Nor mine.
Ok, we’ve got to find a solution.
Can you shout really loudly or sing very very loud?
Me too to be honest.
If we have to stay here any longer, you could work.
I only have my book and I’ve almost finished it.
In any case, I’m happy I’m stuck in the lift with you and not Archibald.
He would have been unbearable.
He would have yelled at me, completely devoid of respect for his boss.
Yes, go on, we could try!
You’re trembling… are you ok?
Really?
It’s my first time too - how funny!
I’m quite stressed too. Did you know that a plane came down just yesterday in Texas?
Don’t even go there! I’m sure it’s a placebo they’ve given you.
Look: my hands are trembling too.
Good idea!
What do you say to a whisky?
I’m going to a seminar on the fear of flying.
I hope it will help me!
Perhaps they’ll give us something to drink!
Oh no… I’d forgotten that I’d need to do this all over again on the way back…
Why? I’m sure your friend will be there.
Except if she has a car accident of course!
Don’t you speak Lithuanian?
Don’t worry. I’m sure we’ll all arrive in one piece, your friend included!
Thank you!
The whole thing’s going to be in Lithuanian. I’m not going to understand anything.
Oh well!
Hello, what are you doing lost in this evil forest?
How are you planning on getting out of here?
That’s sad.
But don’t worry.
You can use medicinal herbs to heal you and get you back on your feet!
We’ll go find the herbs and try to make an ointment.
Then we can try to call for help by making a musical instrument.
Because there isn’t any reception here.
Have you got any?
Because with an instrument we could communicate long-distance without reception.
Taking inspiration from traditional communication methods, we could maybe get out of this tight spot.
We could make a tom-tom, but we would need bison skin!
Or make a distress signal with a big fire.
We could use the smoke to communicate using Morse code.
Haha there aren’t shops like that here.
But yeah, a fire could be useful.
Have you got any other ideas in mind?
Because blindly continuing with an injured knee doesn’t seem like a good idea to me.
You are wholly capable of succeeding.
Don’t give up!
Your classwork and your questions show that you are very bright.
There’s a revision course next week.
That could help to reassure you.
You can ask all the questions you have left to ask following your revision this weekend.
All the teachers are available.
Start with simple questions.
What’s more, there will be cake during the revision course.
We will go over the basics if necessary, but you mustn’t give up.
Which parts of the curriculum do you think you’re the most lost with?
Times tables?
So we’ll spend a little time each day next week revising times tables.
What other parts of the curriculum appear difficult?
You could perhaps use an automatic translator to help you?
The software in the field is getting better and better.
I always have bread left at the end of the week and I like coming here to enjoy the peace and quiet.
How about you?
What brings you here?
That’s for sure.
What do you do for a living?
I prefer ducks myself. I find swans can be mean.
But the young are cute, that’s true.
Journalism must be a difficult job, right?
I work in IT and I work from home too.
The advantage is the freedom it gives.
Do you publish under a pseudonym or your real name?
I develop software for companies.
I’m a specialist of artificial intelligence.
But I also do web development. It helps pay the bills.
I guess that helps you avoid being hounded.
What subjects do you write about?
It’s a real problem, you’re right.
If we carry on like this, we’re heading for disaster, for sure. 
It’s not bad and the work’s varied.
It’s quite relaxed day to day, it’s true.
I’m going to have to leave you.
I don’t have any more bread and it’s getting late.
It was a pleasure to meet you!
You too, see you soon.
You don’t look so well!
Really?
Don’t worry, everything will go fine!
No, but exactly… the engineers who make the planes know what they’re doing.
The pilots too!
And not just anyone becomes a pilot, you know!
They do years and years of studying!
Yes, I fly very often.
Look out the window!
Look at how beautiful that sea of clouds is…
What you’re saying is poetic, but it’s not very positive!
Come on now, be brave!
There are only 12 and a half hours of the flight left!
I mean that there are only twelve or thirteen hours of the flight left before arriving in Australia!
No problem, right?
Haha!
You know, the length of time doesn’t change a think.
Statistically, accidents generally happen at take-off or landing!
As you wish!
Right, have a good time!
Hello Sandra. I have something to ask you for the next class.
I’d like to remind you that classes are compulsory.
You can enjoy the nice weather in a few weeks.
Especially as next week, I need you to do a presentation on your favourite subject: the effect of climate change on earthworms.
I’m certain, given the quality of your essay on the subject, that you are passionate about the future of earthworms.
I want all the students to benefit from your expertise.
Have you been drinking?
I remind you that we’re at university!
I’m not interested in children’s songs!
I see you have some character.
We’ll see if you still have as much during your next exam!
I warn you, I’ll be particularly strict on you.
I appreciate your advice, but let me remind you that I am the teacher and you are the student.
Therefore I’m the one giving advice.
And I advise you to work hard and to come in next week with a presentation for your classmates.
Your offer is making me feel uncomfortable.
I would rather we end our conversation!
I’ll see you next week. Your work had better be of a high standard!
Hello, how are you?
It’s been several weeks since we last saw each other!
Oh really, why?
Can you not find any talking points with them?
Perhaps they are a lot older than you.
I understand.
But are there activities for which you’re all together? Walking, board games, shows…?
No, of course not.
I hope then that you get to go out on walks, even if it’s by yourself.
And I hope you still play guitar!
That’s very kind of your grandson.
Even if the staff is strict for security reasons, do you still get on well with them?
If you make them laugh, that’s a good sign.
And how about the food?
I remember you saying that it wasn’t great.
I can bring you biscuits if you want!
I agree, that doesn’t sound great.
There’s a restaurant not too far from here. You could go there every now and then even though the staff don’t like you going out too much.
I’ve come to see you.
It’s been several months since we last saw each other.
How have you been?
How’s your health?
Ah I’m glad to hear you’re in good health.
Yes, I’d like a coffee.
And how are things here?
Are you still as happy with your retirement home?
I seem to recall that the food wasn’t very good.
Yes, that’s what I remember about the food.
Do you get to go out for a walk every now and then?
I hope the retirement home organises varied activities.
Oh that’s good.
And is there nothing on the premises?
If I remember correctly, last time somebody was meant to come and give a seminar on Ancient Egypt.
And how about music?
You still play the piano, I hope?
I’m doing very well and hope to be use as lively as you at 85! Do you get lots of visitors?
Good evening darling!
How are you?
How did your day go?
Oh my poor darling!
What happened?
Good, nothing special.
Was it your father’s old friend? The lech who stares at all the girls with his big pervy eyes.
I remember him. He did always stare at you in a way that was frankly inappropriate.
A young girl working in the retirement home?
Poor thing, spending her life among frustrated old men and old biddies.
In a way she’ll have earnt it…
But we are a bit short of money these days.
Yes, they’re my small pleasures.
But you too like several glasses of French wine before dinner.
You have to make the most of life!
You could try to convince the dirty lech that Anya doesn’t want his money and that you are the only person who really loves him!
That could work - old people are often very paranoid.
Exactly!
Great!
In the meantime, shall we open a bottle?
Good evening! How was your day?
My poor baby. He has been all wet all day long. I hope you didn’t catch cold.
But I did tell you to dress appropriately.
A mini-skirt and summer shoes in April in London is risky.
I stayed nice and warm with the dog.
As long as you don’t ask me to watch football and reheat a frozen pizza, you can stay as long as you want in the shower and drink your beer.
Since you’re all wet, take the time to go walk the dog. I’ll run you a bath and order an Indian.
You’re joking. It’s a house dog. When I wanted to take him out in the rain, he didn’t want to go out - he just stuck his nose outside, peed by the corner of the house and tugged on his lead to go back home.
Not at all. You can plan to move to Lapland if you want. I’m going to the Côte d’Azur!
I’m a sensitive and fragile person, just like my little dog.
I like sun.
I hate this country where the weather’s terrible for 9 months of the year.
Perhaps for the eskimos, but not for me.
I want sun.
I’d always agree to go on a cruise to the Arctic Circle or to go to the White Nights Festival in Saint Petersburg, but not to go live north of the 45th parallel.
Sorry, north of the 45th parallel.
Shall I bring you your beer in the bath?
Ok, I’ll bring it to you, but afterwards leave me in peace please. I still have to work a bit and dinner will be here in about 30 minutes.
A coffee and freshly squeezed orange juice.
Just a large glass of squeezed orange juice, no ice.
A flat white coffee, since I’ve never tasted one before.
What’s it like?
Great. I’ll also have some buttered toast and a croissant.
Yes, I’m just passing through town for a work meeting.
What is worth visiting here?
Where’s the art gallery and the cathedral?
Are they far from here?
Great.
By the way, I just tasted your flat white coffee.
Not great.
What do you put in it?
Maple syrup?
No thanks.
Do you have any other special recipes here?
By the way, I’d like a little sugar and a straw for my orange juice.
Yes thank you. And I’d like today’s paper if you have it.
Oh, it’s very kind of you to come to see me!
Yes it has been a long time!
How are you doing?
You look very well!
Oh yes, I know just what you mean!
You could come and live here, in this retirement home. What do you think?
Do you think you’d like it here?
There are lots of activities and the staff are very nice.
Especially little Ania. She’s my favourite!
Yes of course - I haven’t lost it yet, you know!
But looking after you must take up quite a bit of his time.
And here they have everything you need!
We watch films, play games, there’s a library…
And the meals are quite good.
And you know me… I have high standards when it comes to food!
Duck magret with lingonberry jam.
It’s difficult to cook duck well, especially when making it for so many people. But here, the cook manages very well!
Yes!
Roger, my neighbour, only eats soup, you’re right.
But it’s because he doesn’t have any teeth left, the poor old man.
I’m lucky - I have almost all my teeth.
Do you want to go to the common room for a cup of tea?
Splendid.
And they have good cake.
And it’s free!
Well, it’s just as well it’s free given what I’m paying each month.
As soon as I manage to get up on my feet, we’ll go!
Ah yes, very good idea.
It's been at least 15 minutes since I last saw her. I miss her.
I can dream, can’t I?
It’s a secret!
You’re not supposed to know!
If you come to live here, we could live together!
We could try, my dear!
Look, here comes Ania.
Let’s go have some tea!
Do you plan on inviting a lot of people?
That’s not a very Christian idea!
Yeah, you could also eat a cake all by yourself!
You need to invite lots of people and prepare lots of cake for the party to be good.
Actually, I hope you didn’t invite Robert.
Oh dear!
I’m warning you, it’s me or Robert.
I was planning on inviting Rachel. You know her.
You know she won’t come without her dog.
She’s been so… strange since she’s been doing her PhD.
We’ll stick it on the balcony. With a bit of luck it’ll jump!
No more horrible than Rex.
I had a Rottweiler but I had to get rid of it. It ate my neighbour.
So we ate the Rottweiler for my son’s birthday.
The Rottweiler?
No, he asked for more.
I was a bit worried by that.
I’ll take the basket if it’s ready!
Please do. I like berries a lot.
A lot more than rabbits!
Yes, you’re right.
Especially as we don’t have a tent to shelter in.
And it’s starting to get a bit chilly.
I wouldn’t say no to the scarf, as I’m really quite cold.
And I’ve got a cold, so I should probably cover up.
I’ll warm myself up with your scarf!
Great!
Oh, that’s a shame.
But I think I have a Thermos flask at the bottom of the basket.
There’s hot water in it!
And I brought some teabags!
We can make some tea to warm up!
No, not at all!
Are you off on holiday?
Every week.
My company is split between two countries.
You’ll see, it’s very pleasant once we’re up there.
From above, the clouds are like a sea of cotton.
And the light is really splendid.
And also, it’s the safest means of transport, or so as they say.
They’ll be coming round with the drinks soon.
You should ask for a glass of wine.
I can see your bag very well.
I’ll just take your credit card and pay for both of us and for our neighbour to the right, if that’s ok with you.
What’s your card’s pin code?
But why are you saying “tu” to me???
I'll get the air stewardess.
She’ll bring you a glass of water.
But relax.
Everything’ll be ok.
Flying’s very safe.
And there are always films to take your mind off it.
We’ve been in the air for a while.
We’ll be there in 5 minutes.
You’ve almost finished your first flight!
It’s chocolate laxative!!!
You haven’t eaten it, have you?
I think I’m going to have to change seats…
Good morning.
How do you feel today?
You finally separated from your partner?
And how do you feel?
Free?
Relieved?
Perhaps a little worried too?
He’s young, but that’s no excuse for his selfishness.
And most importantly, the relationship was hurting you.
But you didn’t answer me: how do you feel now, having left him?
Careful, I’m just your psychiatrist!
What exactly do you think you know?
You’re putting me in a difficult position.
I’m your psychiatrist.
When I listen to you and talk to you, it’s for your psychological well-being, because that’s my job.
It’s not a game. It’s just how therapy works.
Listen, I think you need to have a think about what you’re expecting from your psychiatrist.
Maybe you need to continue therapy with another psychiatrist.
Because I get the feeling that, in your mind, things are different from how they need to be for things to happen as they should.
I think we should finish this meeting now.
Besides, it’s time for my next patient.
Or patient should I say.
Oh dear, I don’t recognise where I am at all.
How about you?
Very, isn’t it.
Right, do you have your compass?
We’ll have a look at the map.
I thought you were bringing your compass…
Does your telephone have one?
All you need is GPS, no need for a data connection.
I have the map.
Right… we’re really not very organised.
Too bad.
We’ll do as you suggested and try to retrace our steps.
I have a torch.
That’s something at least…
With this morning’s rain, the ground is very muddy, that’s for sure.
But without a compass it’s difficult to know which direction we should go in, even with the map.
But since we came from the south, I think we should be able to  make do…
Very good idea.
Climbing that hill will certainly give us a clear view and the village will be lit up so we’ll easily see it in order to go in the right direction.
Let’s go!
It’s a “crag”?
I don’t know what it is.
I’m not sure I want to vomit rocks.
But ok, let’s go!
We’ll make it. You’ve helped boost my morale!
Exactly.
Ok, off we go now. Let’s not dawdle otherwise we’ll be there in several days time!
Yes you’re right.
Watch out.
Anyway, it’s great - we’ve almost reached the village!
Not really, no.
I don’t like flying at all, especially when the weather’s bad like today.
Not really, no.
I don’t like flying at all, especially when the weather’s bad like today.
The crew’s instructions don’t help much when you’re scared of flying!
There’s nothing they can do about turbulence!
Yes, logic would indeed have it that we would get it that flying is the safest form of transport.
I’d like to play a card game.
It’ll help take my mind off it.
Oh I’d like to play poker.
It’s the only game I know!
But tell me, you don’t seem very stressed. Do you fly often?
Yes, definitely.
The advantage of an operation is that you’re asleep during it!
Are you travelling for work or for a holiday?
Yes, a nice glass of champagne would do me good.
Ok then, let’s start.
Emma, please leave me laze around in peace. I want to rest.
I know, I know, and you can’t stay still. You’re incapable of taking any quiet time to just think.
Or to just think of nothing.
And yet it’s so nice - you should try it.
Those French - always attracting attention.
Don’t you have a book or a crossword?
I can lend you a comic. I brought some great ones.
Are you joking?
We’ll walk for an hour and a half and then we won’t even have any more time to go back by the pool.
It’ll be time for pre-dinner drinks.
You are really unbelievable.
If you want we’ll go for a walk tomorrow.
Ok.
And afterwards, I’ll be a nicer holiday companion, I promise.
I would like an orange juice.
Sorry to be such a party pooper, but I’m really tired.
Credit to you for putting up with me!
Shall we go?
I like the pool, but we’re not staying here all afternoon!
Don’t you want to go for a little hike?
The mountains are beautiful here!
Well yeah , we’ve already spent 3 hours by the pool.
I’m starting to get bit bored. Aren’t you?
I don’t understand how you can be happy doing nothing for hours.
I find it totally unfathomable.
So you still want to stay here?
No, no, I don’t want to go alone. It’s ridiculous.
But yet again, when we want to do different things, we end up doing what you want to do.
It’s always like that.
You don’t seem to give a damn about what I think.
It’s annoying, you know.
What do you suggest?
Who is the wise man of the woods?
Ok.
Let’s do that.
Thanks for listening to me for once!
Darling, it’s your birthday in exactly 2 months. We need to organise a party, don’t you think?
If you want!
How many people do you think we can invite to ours?
Ok, sounds good to me.
But it’s really down to you to choose. It’s your birthday after al!
It’s certainly the easiest option.
But you know I like to cook, so I can also do some things if you want.
Yes of course!
What are your favourite fruits?
Ok, I’ll make that for you.
I can also prepare verrines if you want.
They’re practical at parties.
Yeah why not.
I like the idea of James Bond characters.
It encourages people to be a bit classy.
Do you want me to be James?
The problem is there will probably be several Jameses.
I don’t really look like him…
So, and in terms of drinks, what do you suggest?
We could do sangria.
Yes, good idea!
Sangria and punch.
All that’s left do is the guest list and sending the invitations.
Yeah, there’s no point in doing invitation cards.
Email will do!
This is just the holiday I wanted.
A pool, sun and nothing else.
I forgot - a good book.
I see the city the rest of the year!
Yes, but it’s nice now and then to stop somewhere and relax.
But what are you talking about?
You can go if you want and then you can come back and find me.
I don’t want to get tired out.
I won’t move from here!
And how would that make me look?
Find me another pool in town.
We’ll go into town tomorrow.
Yes yes I promise.
Think about what we can do.
Can you put some suncream on me now please?
Hello Lucien. How are you today?
Have you spoken to the retirement home’s nurses or doctor about it?
Perhaps they can suggest something to relieve the pain?
I’m not sure the doctor would agree, but I can always ask him.
I’ve brought cakes with me…
Perhaps that will cheer up you a bit…
If we’re going to buy a bottle of wine and drink it in secret, you might as well get a good bottle…!
I also brought your favourite jazz CDs.
That’s not a bad idea…
But how could be avoid the smoke setting off the fire alarm…
Remember the last time, when it got set off…
And the nurses weren’t happy because they thought there was a fire in the building…
Yes, but cigar smoke isn’t very inconspicuous…
I’ll bring the cakes for our improvised aperitif.
I thought you had aches all over?
You want to go dancing?
Without wishing to cause offence, I’m not sure you’ll have much success with the young women with your Zimmer frame and your false teeth…
You have a point there…
It wasn’t insulting, but realistic…
But otherwise I agree with you…
I’m not very seductive either with my false teeth and huge glasses.
I think I might have offended you…
But remember…although we were once young and beautiful, we’re now old, though we haven’t lost our charm…
Despite the false teeth, glasses and Zimmer frame…
Doctor, I have been able to sleep for several nights.
Something is troubling me.
But I can’t understand what.
I’m not sleeping.
I’m trying to find out what’s troubling me.
And if I manage to fall asleep, I have strange dreams.
Yes, it’s possible.
Or perhaps not.
Perhaps it’s an anxiety from further back.
Yes.
I’m in an aquarium.
Everything is dark around me.
I can easily move around between the rocks and the seaweed.
The aquarium is huge - I can’t see the glass.
The fish say hello to me.
Some ignore me.
I don’t know their names.
Of all different sizes.
I think there’s the Little Mermaid’s grandfather too.
Yes, he’s there.
He’s cooking fried eggs.
Chickens?
With eggs?
Oh no.
Enormous eggs.
Perhaps they are eggs from enorm… fish
Sorry a mistake.
Perhaps the eggs come from enormous fish.
Oh what’s going on now?
Yes, but be quick, I have a meeting in 15 minutes.
Ok?
Well look, you’re just in front of it.
You really can’t count on anyone in this building anymore!
I’m going to have to complain to the technical department!
It’s outrageous!
I won’t calm down!
I have a conference call with the Tokyo office in less than 15 minutes.
I can’t miss it.
The company’s depending on it.
Your salary depends on it.
So call for help!
There - the big red button!
Push it for God’s sake!
RIght, my telephone isn’t working in this bloody metal box.
Oh no, you’re not going to sing, are you?
I hate singers.
My ex-husband was a singer.
He used to sing all the time.
You could never concentrate at home.
Nor sleep.
He even used to sing in his sleep.
I don’t know why I’m telling you that.
Get us out of here!
Ah hello Michelle, I’m happy to see you. It’s been ages!
Unfortunately, the humidity is playing tricks on me and my arthritis is terribly painful.
That’s kind of you, but you know how it is at my age…
Dear Simon, how is he since all this time?
Has he at last taken the time to sign up to the Friends’ Association?
That’s a real shame!
I think he should have taken part in the meet-ups for young pensioners, while he’s still wet behind the ears.
But perhaps you should also sign up to the activities?
It was great seeing you too!
Hopefully I can come see you soon!
If you like nature, it’s difficult to escape insect bites.
But why the blocked nose? Are you allergic to something? Flowers, trees…?
You need to do a desensitisation test.
You may be allergic to animal fur.
But none of that helps us figure out where we are.
Do you have an idea of which direction to go in?
No I don’t think we should head to the pond.
But we do need to get out of the forest quickly.
And how about if we started shouting?
Or simply retracing our steps? 
Yeah I could use my beautiful voice.
I didn’t think of bringing my megaphone.
Sorry.
But I do have lots of water. We can still survive for some time.
Do you have your smartphone on you?
Shall we try Google Maps?
Do you want us to roam around sniffing the ground?
No, it’s a joke.
We should never have left the paths. You’re the one who wanted to go into the forest to eat wild strawberries.
Incidentally, I think that might be what set off your allergic reaction.
Or it could be the six little pistachio macaroons you had for a snack.
Oh no, I saw everything.
Do you know how to navigate by the sun’s position?
I don’t really.
I might take out my smartphone and use Google anyway. But if I understood correctly, that will set off your allergies again!!
It’s never the right time for a lift breakdown!
Let’s set off the alarm.
Really?
What do you want us to do?
Even if it falls at a bad time, better that than the lift falling!
I’m not offended, but I’m struggling to see how I can get out of a lift breakdown.
It
is not a reason to set off the alarm.
I find you very aggressive.
Let’s try to find a solution instead.
Or don’t you want to make the most of the situation to spend a good time together without being aggressive?
Erm… That sort of depends on you…
Open minded, perhaps, but in a very confined space.
I’d prefer narrow-mindedness in an open space.
That’s convenient, I think there’s a bar in the lift.
I don’t know how we’re going to get out of the lift and of this dialogue, which I prefer to put an end to (while waiting for the repairman).
Here we go.
The lift’s broken down again.
I think as the boss, you should do something to stop it breaking down!
Ah, bosses are all the same.
I don’t think it’s a matter of time.
More a matter of money, don’t you say?!?
Exactly.
If the system is old and out of date, doesn’t that pose safety problems for your employees?
It’s worth spending millions to protect us.
Well, well you’re unbelievable, you are!
It’s up to us to pay for repairs with our salary now?
Mind-boggling.
You should start shouting with me to get help instead.
Oh no problem.
I don't see anything against using the stairs.
But you, the bosses, should have to do the same thing.
That could be true.
Lots of our bosses are also fat and will lose weight by taking the stairs!
Modest and proud of it, I see.
Ah, there we go.
The door’s open.
Goodbye, you old Scrooge.
Oh, did you bring both?
Great!
I suggest we give the white bread to that group and the brown bread to that other group.
I heard that bread was harmful to ducks.
We’ll be able to compare the efficiency of white bread and brown bread on these ducks.
It’ll be interesting.
They want us to feed ducks with crackers and biscuits?
That’s stupid - they’re too fatty and too salty.
And full of preservatives.
At least bread is healthy!
On the other hand, it could make foie gras.
In any case, they seem to like both types just as much!
Look, the little ducklings are coming in single file!
I don’t even think I really know what ducks eat in the wild.
Yes, it’s quite cute.
I’m a bit disappointed - they seem to be digesting the bread fine for now.
Absolutely.
But even among the adults there seem to be dominant ones and weak ones.
Look at that one there. Each time, it rushes towards the piece of bread to steal it from its rightful recipient.
Can we fish here?
There’s a fisherman over there.
There are turtles?
I like turtles a lot!
I should think so!
I love their little alien heads and their old-man wrinkly skin!
When I was little, I hated my cousin, in the countryside, who used to turn tortoises onto their backs.
I found it totally mean and unjustified.
And I used to delicately turn them back onto their feet each time.
Yes, it’s the food chain.
That being said, I doubt that falcons are interested in turtles.
That’s for special occasions!
Right, the ducks are still here.
They want more bread.
Is there any left?
Yes, they are.
Shall we chuck them what’s left?
I’m really tired today… I suggest we stay by the pool!
To be honest, I would rather stay and have some peace and quiet with my mother… you know that she can’t walk that much.
Why not, but right now I’m making the most of the pool for a little bit longer. 
Don’t you want to do some lengths?
Yeah, maybe later!
I’ll watch you do your lengths and perhaps we’ll go afterwards.
I read, I rest, I go have a drink outside… how about you?
How about in an hour?
Oh!
Are you up for fetching us some drinks?
Get me a coffee please!
If you want, you could go for a stroll with the dog too.
He can stretch his legs - he’d like that.
Americano with sugar please.
Ask my mother if you can get her something too!
I’m not sure these ducks are going to like our old bread.
Oh right, they don’t like bread?
What did you bring them?
Not peas, did you?
I would never have thought of that.
Oh very well then, I won’t given them any more bread.
Yes, I also really like this pond with its ducks and swans.
Do you often come to relax here?
I often come to read here.
To look at the ducks, pretty girls too… What kind of work do you do from home?
About cats?
I love animals, but unfortunately I’m allergic to animal hair.
Other than that, I’m a musician in a jazz group.
I play the saxophone.
I find it’s an instrument with a fabulous sound.
Sometimes the trumpet.
I hope so.
Give me you email address. I’ll send you the advert for your next concert.
Help!
Help!
I’m lost deep in the woods… I  don’t know what happened.
I went to pick mushrooms in an area I thought I knew well.
I strayed a little … and when I turned around I didn’t recognise where I was.
How about you?
What did you do?
No!
No!
They’re poisonous!
I’m preparing a magic potion, but I won’t tell you what it’s for. 
Oh yeah?
Really?
Which ingredients?
It’s a very old magic potion recipe with a mystery ingredient, you see…
Ok, I’ll give you the magic ingredient… It’s…
Laughing Cow!
Sorry… give you
A bit of both.
Laughing Cow!
Laughing Cow in English :)
A melted cheese made in the Vosges.
Yes, absolutely!
But there are lots of other ingredients in this potion.
It’s going to be intense this morning!
We need to start preparing the cake for the wedding!
I think you can start to make the caramel. The baker has already prepared the choux buns.
We’ve got lined up:
A vegetable, walnut oil and roquefort puff pastry.
Then monkfish with bacon and lentils.
With white wine.
And for dessert: the wedding cake!
Yes, that’s for the cocktail reception!
There are salmon, caviar and foie gras ones.
You mean how many guests?
I think there are going to be one hundred and twenty of them!
Great! I’ll continue preparing the dessert then!
No, I don’t believe it!
Are you serious?
Dammit!
We could try to replace it with the duck magret then I suppose…
On no, don’t worry. It’s not your fault!
I wonder what could have happened. Perhaps we got the order wrong…
But you’ve cut your finger off!
You need to go to accident and emergency!
I’m scared of blood. I’m going to faint.
Oh God, I don’t feel too well.
I’m going to be sick.
You’re very resourceful, I see.
That’s exactly what we’ll do.
Can you call the bride and groom?
Hello darling, how did your day go?
Oh dear, I don’t really understand.
You left our broken-down car to go take the train?
And since the train was full you left on foot?
I understand that you must have arrived late for work.
Well no darling, I don’t really understand what happened to you.
My day was excellent.
But how did you get home?
Did you leave your car at work?
Well, aside the little transport problem, how are things with your boss?
After all, that’s the main problem.
No!
Your boss is inviting you to the theatre?
I’m not sure I’m ok with that.
I love the theatre.
Which play are they doing?
I’m hungry too. We can go to the restaurant if you want.
Hi!
So, it’s my birthday next week and I’d like to organise a big party!
I don’t know yet, but I’m siding more towards a big party with all my friends.
My place isn’t big enough. Perhaps I could hire a room or rent a bar?
Thanks very much!
It’s most probably too late to hire a room then.
Do you know any nice bars near to here that would be big enough?
Thanks, that’s great advice!
I just called them and they said yes!
So we’ve got the room at the back — it’s begin enough — from 7pm.
I’d like to have male strippers… Do you think the barman would allow it?
Hahaha
On a more serious note, you’re right - musicians help to create a good atmosphere.
I have a friend who’s in a band. I’ll ask him to come and play a bit.
Erm, they’ve just started out actually…they’re a bit amateur.
Actually it’s an experimental group. They combine lots of different music styles!
They play the accordion, the banjo, the drum and the recorder!
Do you think it might ruin the evening?
Phew, I feel reassured!
We just need to send out the invitations now.
You’ll be the first to receive one of course!
Excuse me, are you ok?
Is it your first time taking the plane?
I fly often too.
So you’re still scared of planes, even though you’re a frequent flyer?
That’s surprising!
Did you have a bad experience?
Oh no, I’m very well, thank you.
I just have a naturally pale complexion, that’s all.
You’re the one who looks really stressed.
Don’t worry, everything will be ok.
Really?
If you’re right, I hope it’s nothing serious.
But if I start to have digestive problems, I have a simple solution: ask the stewardess for a glass of whisky.
Then again, a whisky would be perfect to combat stress too.
Erm… if you want.
Do you fancy a whisky?
Very well.
But I’m going to have a whisky anyway.
Oh damn, they only have Jack Daniels.
Why don’t they have any Scottish whisky?
It’s really not the same thing!
Ah yes, we’ve finally landed.
Very good, have a good day.
We’re expecting 10 people for dinner tonight…
I suggest we discuss the menu together.
10 customers have reserved for this evening at 10 o’ clock.
That’s the question…
My understanding is that there’ll be a film star among the guests…
So we mustn’t disappoint them…
Tom Hanks.
He’s very nice apparently.
We should be able to ask him for an autograph at the end.
And I don’t think he’s vegetarian.
We could prepare a scallop carpaccio for the starter.
We take scallops.
We take out the edible part and cut it into fine slices…
that we then marinate in lemon juice.
I think it could make a nice starter.
Yes, very good idea to follow up with the meat dish!
Do you have any ideas?
Do you mean blackberries?
Or a blackberry tart to finish?
That’s a good idea. It’s original and the guests are sure to like it a lot.
And how about dessert?
Perhaps we could make a lemon tart?
Or perhaps chocolate macaroons?
Really?
I also watch that programme!
Oh it’s a pleasure to see you.
It’s been a long time and since I don’t get many visitors…
You’ve just got back from holiday?
Very good.
Where did you go this year?
My holidays amount to a couple of walks around the retirement home.
Hawaii?
Great!
What did you do there?
Underwater fishing, boat trips…?
Anyway, yes I’ve made a couple of friends here I chat to about music and literature… not to mention chess games!
I would like to go to visit Hawaii!
And where are you going to live now?
Do you still work as a maths teacher?
Going from teaching maths to dance is very original!
But you said you were going away on honeymoon!
What does your husband do??
Hi, how did you day go?
Tell me about it.
What happened?
Is there no other solution?
That’s not possible!
But we don’t have them!
Can’t you call on a lawyer?
Not especially.
We’ll surely be able to find one in the forest.
Are you stupid?
Pay even more?
And what if it doesn’t work?
And where am I going to find a billion euros?
My parents won’t want to lend me such a sum.
I’m going to sleep.
We’ll think about it tomorrow.
I am very happy to have joined the group.
It’s a great opportunity for me.
How are you today?
Have you found new projects for our programme?
Yes, I think we should push the help button.
But I don’t think it’s working at the moment.
Perhaps we should bang on the doors to make some noise.
What do you think?
I can hear a noise.
I think our colleagues have called for help.
Whilst we’re waiting, we could talk about our future projects.
What do you think?
It just happens that I have the plans I am to show you tomorrow morning.
Do you want to see them?
After getting out of the lift, I have to dash to my office to print the new maps.
And you, boss?
Yes, liberation shouldn’t be too long.
Who are you expecting?
Who do you have a meeting with this afternoon?
Great!
Have a good meeting.
So we’re stuck.
And I have an important meeting to go to!
Let’s hope that’s true and they’ll quickly notice that something is amiss.
And how about you, what department do you work in?
What type of oil do you market?
And why do you want to exchange our products?
You’d be better off selling them!
It’s normal to be a bit stressed in such a small space as a lift.
Breathe deeply and you’ll feel better.
Help will be coming soon.
Oh yes, I see.
Childhood memories always stay with you, especially if they are unpleasant!
It’s not very nice to go through such an experience all alone, especially when you’re a child.
But I can hear noises.
Hang in there, help’s arriving!
Hi Caroline, aren’t you a bit bored here?
I’d like to go have bit of a walk, to get a change of scenery.
Exactly! Walking is good for digestion.
Doing lengths in a small pool isn’t very original.
Whilst there’s a little path leading to the forest right there.
Then never mind! I’m going to leave you to it and we can meet up late afternoon.
See you!
Oh hello Léontine, how are you?
You look very well!
You’re welcome. It’s always a please to see you, you know.
That darn backache!
I read it’s the disease of the century.  However, I would have liked it not to last a century!!
Without a hitch.
Are you still good here?
I feel for you about the back and I’m sorry!
I hope it’ll ease up soon.
The staff does look very nice.
I saw your brother yesterday!
We bumped into each other in the street. It was funny!
He was chatting to a friend whilst walking the dog.
He asked me to say hello to you for him and to tell you that he’ll come by on Tuesday if he can.
A bit, yes. That’s why it was surprising!
He must be close to his friend’s.
I didn’t ask him for details. You know how your brother likes to keep his private life to himself.
I’d quite like a caipirinha.
With some olives and sausage slices if possible.
You don’t have any sausage?
Never mind.
I’m quite surprised you know what a caipirinha is.
It’s not a very common aperitif in Europe.
Where did you learn how to make it?
Great!
That’s some experience!
Which countries did you go to?
What’s your favourite aperitif?
Yes a glass of champagne is always, everywhere, an excellent aperitif.
You’ve travelled a lot!
Which country did you like the most?
Yes, lots of things to see in South America.
Did you get to go to Argentina or go to see the Inca ruins?
I hope you got to go to Mach Picchu anyhow.
Did you bring back any souvenirs from those South American countries?
Yes of course.
And to Mexico.
I brought back in particular some very beautiful stones.
Are you interested in mineralogy?
Good evening.
So how did your day go?
Mine went very well.
As expected.
But you had a difficult meeting planned…
So you mean that after your meeting, you tried to find somewhere to eat alone, but you couldn’t find a quiet room?
Pfft. That’s unlucky.
I know that when you need peace and quiet, you really need peace and quiet.
My day was relaxed.
A good productive meeting in the morning and this afternoon I managed to finish my report.
Did you manage to calm down for the lunch?
Oh.
That’s good.
What did you write about?
What’s a bowl of chirashi-yum?
I’ve never had it.
The meeting went quite well.
There are indeed a couple of problems.
It’s a bit heavy going.
But we pulled through.
No, not really.
You know those kinds of things take time.
How about you?
But who’s an asshole?
The US president?
But young lady, history is a very important subject.
Through it you can understand the present and prepare for the future by studying the past.
And it’s part of any educated person’s general knowledge.
Not knowing history means coming from nowhere and being lost in the present.
Each teacher is specialist in a subject.
I agree with you that certain topics aren’t dealt with enough.
But history is important.
It’s also through history that we can understand democracy, politics and our country’s cultural identity.
And aren’t you fascinated by ancient civilisations?
The birth of writing?
Of course it is, since history often repeats itself.
Studying the consequences of decisions taken in the past allows us to understand which are the good decisions to take today!
Let’s take an example.
After the first world war the victors decided to make Germany pay huge reparations.
It was a fortune.
It ruined the German economy and indirectly led to the second world war.
In the aftermath of the second world war, the victors understood as a result that they mustn’t commit the same error again.
And they created Europe instead.
And now we’ve lived in peace for 70 years in Europe.
I don’t think so.
We’ll always need to write letters, sign documents…
So what are you interested in?
Which subjects do you find useful?
Yes, they are very important topics, you’re right.
Do you plan on studying it?
You should start to look into which universities have courses that might interest you.
But the environment is a really fascinating subject and is very important for our future, so I encourage you to keep at it!
It depends what you want to do for a career.
You don’t need a degree to change your day-to-day behaviour and to encourage those around you to do the same.
But if you want to go further, for example by going into research or engineering, you’ll need skills and degrees that only higher education can give you.
You should look into it, because manufacturing computers and iPads creates a lot of pollution.
Whereas paper can be manufactured in an environmentally friendly way, by replanting trees.
Because today we don’t yet know how to make them without polluting.
Electronic devices contain a number of toxic substances, for example in the batteries, screen and processors.
I am thinking in particular of semi-conductors, which are almost exclusively produced in China, in highly polluting mines.
But you could speak to your Physics teacher about it, if you’re interested.
I have to leave you now, since the next class is starting in 1 minute!
See you next week!
You’re right.
I’ll wash my hands straight away!
What do you want us to prepare next for this evening’s menu?
I think we had to prepare a fish starter.
Then a meat main course and finally a dessert with red berries.
What do you mean exactly by “bream”? I’m not sure I understood correctly.
Thank you for clarifying.
Perhaps we could marinate it in lemon and with a bit of olive oil?
To serve it as a starter, with some fresh vegetables?
Ah yes, that’s a very good idea!
Seaweed will give it a slightly salty touch, and it’s original!
Of course.
We could perhaps do little lemon tarts with strawberries?
Obesity has become a worldwide problem.
But with good produce, we can inspire people to want to eat better!
You’re right. The strawberries are more than good enough.
Ok.
But we’ve been here for more than an hour already.
We could go for a bit of a walk in town.
Ok, as you wish.
What is the fascinating book you’re reading.
A detective novel?
That sounds like a strange story.
I’m going to go get my science fiction book.
It’s better.
Do you want to drink something?
Because the story of the first men who arrive on Mars and discover traces of an ancient civilisation is far more interesting than your story about genealogists and treasure!
The probability of finding ruins on Mars is small, yes.
I agree with you there.
That said, I don’t hate detective novels.
Agatha Christie novels for example.
Have you read them?
Ok, well I’ll leave you be for another 15 minutes with your genealogist.
Then we can go have some lunch.
Hello!
Have you seen all these ducks?
So you’re feeding them too… What is it?
But you defrost them first, don’t you?
Do they like anything else?
Wait… I think so.
But it’s not that close and I don’t know if it’s open on Sundays.
You have to keep going along the pond and then head up the river for about a hundred metres.
After that, there’s a roundabout and then you can’t miss it.
I recommend their fish and chips - it’s first rate!
Even though I think their peas are frozen too!
I think it’s called “King of the Pond”, but I’m not sure.
I like fish and chips, but I don’t eat much meat.
I prefer vegetables and fish/shellfish.
I prefer ducks in the pond to on my plate!
Ha ha ha - sort of, yes!
But now I think of it, I think the café also does duck à l’orange.
I don’t know if it’s good - you should try it!
Yeah, I know what you mean!
See you soon!
Good evening!
What have you got on draught?
No, I wanted to ask what beers you have on tap!
Or if you have wine, that’ll do me too!
Perfect!
I do like bitter beer.
Could you serve me a pint of that?
I’ll have a whole litre then!
Thank you!
What do you have to snack on?
I’m always responsible!
I’ll take a taxi.
Great!
But I don’t like onions.
Do you have a burger without onions?
I don’t want to be difficult.
But whatever you do, use plenty of cheese!
I’ll need a lot of beer to wash down all those burgers.
Bring me another one soon.
Hello Doctor.
I really need to talk to you.
Can I sit on this chair?
Can I really lie down on the sofa?
Are you sure?
I don’t want to be any bother. It looks clean and new - I’m a bit worried about sitting on it.
I don’t want to ruin it.
I think I would feel more comfortable standing up.
Would you prefer it if I took off my shoes?
Then again my feet might smell bad… I don’t quite know what would be better.
Are you not hot?
I think my neighbours think I want to hurt them.
So I’m scared of staying at home and I try to make as little noise as possible.
But it’s tiring.
I don’t feel at home anywhere, you see.
I don’t know.
But I think it’s been getting worse over time.
And my new neighbours are odd.
They always look at me weirdly.
I think they listen to what I’m doing through the walls.
Oh no, I would be too scared of them noticing me listening to them.
But I can hear them anyway.
The walls aren’t very thick.
That’s also why I feel spied on continually.
But I don’t have enough money to move into a house.
Yes, absolutely. Didn’t I tell you earlier? 
I’m sorry.
It was an elderly woman who couldn’t hear a thing and didn’t make any noise.
I felt more at home.
Ok, thank you for your time. Sorry to have bothered you.
And sorry for being sorry all the time.
I’m sorry.
Hello Miss.
I’m really struggling to understand the probability lesson.
It’s too complicated for me, since I’ve only done literature up until now.
Help me, please!
I know you’re an English teacher, but Mr Jameson is a tyrant!
All he does is put us down and remind us that he is intellectually superior.
I can’t take it anymore and I’m not alone in feeling like this.
And he is constantly harassing my female friends.
That’s just it - the counsellor is in on it all!
They plot together so as not to let any details get out.
Just speaking to you puts me in grave danger.
It’s been going on since we dared to tell him that his lesson was going too fast.
His ego’s too big and he can’t stand being contradicted.
Since he’s friends with the counsellor, he’s having his revenge.
However, since he’s now aware of his power, he’s taking it out on my friends too because they are girls.
Now they hate me because they think it’s my fault.
Thank you so much!
I hope that he rots in prison until the end of his days, eaten by rats.
So Germaine, how are you today?
Ah, that’s good!
All these little aches and pains don’t make life easy!
My grandchildren are well. The youngest, the daughter of my second daughter Marion, just took her first steps, you know!
Ah I know only too well!
Marion has always been everyone’s little darling… A bit like your Oliver, don’t you think?
I don’t have any photos on me - you know, me and technology… My children offered me a tablet, but I don’t know what to do with it!
Luckily for your arthritis! You’re happy here, aren’t you?
The staff seem very caring.
Oh, you must be adept than me then!
My children regularly show me how to turn it on and even how to write emails, but…
with my poor head, it’s too difficult!
Young people are so quick!
Everything must go so fast for them…
Well, if you say so, I’ll stick at it!
Still, what a crazy, crazy time we’re living in!
Everything happens so fast!
Anyway!
My dear Germaine, I’m going to have to leave you. I have an appointment with the rheumatologist at 3pm!
Leaving enough time to get there… As always, it’s been a pleasure to see you.
I was fine until I saw your face.
I can’t stand you anymore.
Have you seen how you speak to me? You aren’t even capable of saying hello.
I demand esteem and mutual respect in a couple.
It’s always one way with you. You irritate me and I realise that I would be much better far away from you.
I’m like Louis Jouvet in Children of Paradise, when he says to Arletty that he needs a change of air.
Do you remember that superb film by Marcel Carné? We saw it in French.
The exact term was “atmosphere” not “air”, but it’s the same thing; I’m suffocating at your side. 
You are primitive, stupid, incapable of growing up.
Living in a universe of manga and cartoons at your age is pathetic.
I need intellectual and emotional stimulation, not living next to a retarded, pimply geek who only thinks of his video games and mangas.
I made a typo: Living in a universe of manga and cartoons at your age is pathetic.
Of course, you assume your sexual deviances and your incapacity to have a satisfying erectile function so poorly that you feel the need to be unpleasant, nasty and humiliating.
I need a real man capable of taking adequate care of his partner, not a half impotent moron who satisfies himself with his cartoon images.
You’re already dimensionally handicapped.
Don’t make it worse by appearing as intellectually inhibited as your miserable instrument. 
Hello!
It’s Julie here!
I’m calling about my birthday.
You know, the party on Saturday 15th, you said you’d help me with the planning.
Actually, I would quite like your help.
It’s becoming a hell of a fiesta!
Well, it would be good if we could meet up 2 hours before.
We’ll need to finish the verrines and get the cutlery and plates out.
And the drinks too.
Either inside, or in the garden, depending on the weather.
Balloons, yes, why not!
The forecast changes every day. It’s hard to tell…  I’ve also ordered a barrel of beer so we can serve draught beer.
People always like that.
But I’ll really need some help to carry it and set it up.
Both!
If there are sailors coming, then we’ll have to go to town on the drinks!
Do you think we’ll need rum?
I love sailors…
Oh no!
But we’ll have to get them to sing!
Are they in the merchant navy or are there also some pirates?
Pirates are the best, especially in terms of rum!
And we’ll dance!
That’s giving me lots of ideas for decorations and costumes!
Ah, you must introduce him to me!
Does he have a parrot?
I prefer parrots to tattoos…
Ok, I’ll think about the decorations and let’s call each other before the party.
Thanks for your help!
And if you have any more ideas, please call me.
I have to dash!
How are you darling?
You don’t look in a very good mood.
Poor you!
What happened to you?
Ouch!
It’s that kind of day when you would have preferred to not have got up in the morning!
Would a little massage make you feel better?
Or a good beer?
Ok for a massage and a rum then.
And what did you boss say?
He was angry at you?
Come on! With what he earns, he can very well buy himself another one!
And it can happen to anyone!
In any case your boss has always been unpleasant!
Why do you think she doesn’t like you?
You’re not a bit paranoid, are you?
Let me point out that you’re on your fifth whisky.
Yes, having something to eat, with mineral water is a good idea.
Here’s the menu.
Sorry, we only serve that dish at lunchtime.
And I advise you to have just the ice cube without the whisky.
I suggest you take a break from alcohol.
Again, you’ve already had 4 whiskys.
Are you planning on driving when you leave here?
I’m not allowed to serve drunk customers.
But you’re being incoherent and I can’t tell whether it’s Diabla slipping up in its translation or a reflection of your mental state.
You’re still standing, but I advise you to go to bed.
That’ll be my last word on the matter.
Hello doctor.
It’s the first time I’m seeing someone. I’m a bit nervous.
I have problems at work. I feel oppressed.
I don’t feel there’s enough staff.
I spend all day running everywhere, following my boss’s orders. I’m completely exhausted by the end of the day…
Last time I think I had a panic attack. I locked myself in the toilet and cried.
I don’t know what to do. What do you suggest I do?
Yes I could go to talk to him, but I’m scared. He’s really on edge at the moment.
Last time, he didn’t welcome me very warmly.
Haha, that’s an idea!
Perhaps he too goes and cries in the toilet every now and then.
We should do group therapy.
He didn’t give me the chance to explain my situation and sent me out of his office with even more work than before!
I must say that when I taste the meals they serve us, I do wonder…
And no time to take a nap given the workload - it’s an outrage!
You can taste it if you’re interested. But I warn you, it’s disgusting.
Thank you for your help, doctor.
It was a pleasure talking with you today!
Yes, it is. But I like coming here even when it’s raining.
After all, ducks eat every day!
Do you come here often?
Are you new to the area?
Oh, where you are going?
We’re in the park of the Alan Turing foundation.
As for me, it’s above all the nearest park to my house.
And as there’s a pond and ducks, I come here often.
I like ducks a lot.
I still have some left if you want.
I always bring too much.
And there are often children, sometimes even adults, who are happy to be given bread to throw to the ducks.
It’s a pleasure to meet you.
How are you?
Growing old is difficult sometimes.
I understand.
And 93 is a more than respectable age, and you’re still fit as a fiddle.
The children are very well thank you.
They’re almost adults now.
Paul is studying architecture.
Emma is in her final year at college doing sciences.
She’s taking her final exams this year.
She’s still doing music and plays in a symphony orchestra.
Is there no way for you to get an association to lend you one?
I know that lots of musical associations work with retirement homes.
Are there never any concerts with musicians?
Only the weekly sing-song?
You should go to speak to the community life council.
They could most certainly put you in contact with an association.
Are the songs really so awful?
Which are they?
From which period?
We hadn’t planned that I stay for dinner and you know that you have to tell them in advance.
I hope that I can come back to see you soon and we can organise for me stay with you for dinner.
It was really really lovely to see you too.
I’ll come back.
Perhaps next week.
These poor ducks look really thin.
Do you have any bread to give them?
Well well, you seem to know a lot about these ol’ ducks!
Where did you learn all that?
Oh I can see you’re a specialist!
I also really like to go walking and listening to the birds, but I don’t know anything about them.
What rare species do you look out for?
Have you travelled to faraway countries to see and listen to very rare species?
Yes, a lot, especially in South America, where there are lots of extraordinary animals in the Amazon Forest.
Have you been?
In Brazil for example there are some extraordinary animals.
Yes, a voyage to South America is quite expensive.
I’d personally like to go to Argentina to see condors.
You need to go to the south, to the Tierra del Fuego.
Chile is a beautiful country too.
You’ll find animals other than these poor ducks!
Hello, how are you?
It’s going well.
It's lovely weather for feeding the ducks.
They look hungry.
Apparently giving bread to ducks isn’t good for them.
It’s better to give carrots.
Don’t carrots float?
If we stretch our hands, perhaps they will come and eat from them.
At worst, they’ll dive.
Yes!
Let’s try.
Quack quack little duck… come here… we have food!
Let’s make the most of it and stroke him before he leaves.
Oh too late.
He got scared.
He’s just left feathers as he left.
Perhaps he’ll let us stroke him next time.
We should go home.
Good evening, my friend.
How are you this evening?
Oh poor old you.
I brought you a bottle of wine. Nobody saw!
I’ll hide it here for you.
That’s for you to decide.
You can keep it fo you, we can drink it together or we can also invite the nurse I passed in the corridor as I was coming in.
She’s pretty good-looking!
A massage?
Did you pay her for it, or does she just like you?
Hmm that’s nice, but a bit strange, don’t you think?
Anyhow, it’s no big deal!
What matter is that there’s a pretty nurse who gives you massages.
Right, shall we open that bottle of wine then?
Great idea!
Shall I go knock on doors or do you have specific people in mind?
Ok, great, I’ll just go get some people and I’ll be back.
Be right back.
Tell me about your mother.
Why are you worried about her?
Oh?
What does she make you do?
Does she constantly tell you what to do and how to do it?
And do you feel permanently judged?
She follows you?
In town, everywhere?
Are you sure it was her?
Who was spying on you?
No, no, I was asking who was spying on you at the door.
And does your mother look like that?
Then it probably wasn’t her, was it?
What was your relationship like with your mother when you were a child?
Did she look after you much?
Did you miss her, when she was far away?
Unfortunately our session is over, it’s time for my next patient.
You’ll come back next week, same day, same time?
Hey you! Have you just arrived in the area?
It’s the first time I’ve seen here, and you’re sat at the regulars’ table.
Oh but you’re a bit of a character!
Don’t be angry!
Can I get you something?
Are you waiting for someone?
I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to pressure you.
I can offer you the daily wines on the slate over there.
Perhaps you would be better at the back table over there?
It’s quite intimate, slightly removed form the other customers.
We only have local beer. The wine comes from Bordeaux or from Côtes du Rhône.
Yes, there are twelve of them and they come every day at 2pm, you see.
They’re real boozers. I suggest you sit a little way away if your meeting is a bit more…romantic. 
Of course, I’ll bring the beer.
Your friend doesn’t seem to be coming.
Do you want me to keep you company for a bit?
I’m called Mathilda.
Do you live around here?
It’s rare to see new faces!
Ok see you tomorrow!
Have a good afternoon!
Hello Maria!
How are you doing?
That’s true - they spend their time bothering us.
They move objects around the rooms.
They tell us to go there, do that, huh.
I was joking!
They do that for your own good.
Yeah, that’s right.
Come on, come on, you know that I would never do that!
Tell me about your day.
What have you had to eat?
Stop saying silly things. They’d never do that.
It’s spring. What do you say to a walk in the park?
We could organise it for a weekend in May.
I’ll ask Marcel, Jeannine and Léon if they want to come along.
That’s a shame - we’ll go without them then!
Good evening.
How’s it going?
Very well thank you.
I don’t really know, to be honest.
I’m struggling to understand differential equations.
Please could you help me?
Unfortunately I didn’t understand the last sentence. Could you reformulate? 
Thank you.
I need an explanation of second derivatives.
I’m struggling to understand the idea.
The exam will cover everything we’ve seen in the second term, right?
No worries, that’s already a big help.
Thank you for your time.
Hey, let’s go swimming :)
Ok, but only if you put down your book.
Haha!
No, no problem!
You are just being too lazy for this wonderful weather!
Come on, we’re going to make the most of it!
Oh no, we’re not going to spend all our time tanning.
I prefer to make the most of the water and cool down a bit.
But do join me!
It’ll do you good, you’ll see.
And I have a frisbee!
We’ll have a right laugh!
Haha!
Show me how it’s done again. I wouldn’t want you to be ashamed of me just yet!
I bet you won’t be able to catch it!
Ok.
Right, a long island ice tea for the lady, and I’ll go get Sacha and Daniel. Don’t move!
It depends on the customer.
If you want one, I’ll make you one.
Otherwise I won’t.
It’s up to you as the customer to decide what’s right for you… up to a point.
Would you like a cocktail with a tasting platter?
We have some special platters.
Especially for sharing.
They’re very good with a mojito for example.
Do you mean a sharing board?
It’s a board with specialities for an aperitif between friends.
No mint?
No problem.
Would you like a planter’s punch?
The basic ingredients are lemon juice, orange juice and grenadine.
A pina colada then?
No problem. I’ll prepare it for you right away.
With a lovely parasol!
A tasting platter with that?
I can do that for you.
Do you have a preference?
Well, usually I serve that cocktail with spicy cod fish cakes and sweet potato crisps.
Will that be ok?
The hamburger will come later.
Yes, we do desserts.
A very good mango soup by the way, that I would recommend if you’re still hungry after your meal.
In the meantime, here’s your number.
We’ll call you when your cocktails and platter are ready.
Feel free to come back up.
Anyway, have a good evening!
Good evening!
Can I have a caipirinha please?
You need to mix cachaça with lime juice, sugar and ice cubes.
Shaken I think.
Chips would be perfect. I’m starving.
I’ve not eaten anything all day!
Oh, I thought they were free with the drink.
I don’t have much money on me.
Ok thank you very much.
But then you must be a new waitress? I come here often and I have never seen you before.
Ho, you’re not my mother!
It’s just that caipirinha reminds me of my travels in Brazil.
I worked there for 6 months as a waitress.
It was last year. I didn’t quite know what I wanted to study after my final exams.
Yes a little bit, but you lose it fast!
Yes, you have the right meeting, that’s correct.
Can you bring one or two bottles of champagne?
You’re right, bring some champomy instead!
Bring cheap ingredients. It’s only my birthday, not an ambssador’s reception.
Sorry, I mean ambassador
The first person who comes with bagpipes will be sent directly back to Scotland.
It’s my birthday. Not a funeral.
Let’s stay with rock’n’roll please.
That’s exactly why they’re your friends, not mine.
That’s exactly why I listen to good English pop rock and never to French, Scottish or Breton music.
But it’s supposed to be my birthday, not your party.
I demand the right to choose the music I like on my birthday. Is that ok with you?
I don’t know it, but you could play it for me or play it to me, but it’s forbidden to cry at my parties, unless it’s out of joy.
Send me the link.
Let's stay simple: pain surprise, salami, bread, pickles, etc.
Hello! Is it the first time you’ve flown?
I’m sensing you’re a bit nervous…
Sometimes these things can’t be explained…
And why are travelling today?
No, I’m on holiday…
You must be really happy to see your daughter!
She’ll be really happy!
What nice things are you bringing her? 
Jams?
Cheese?
Chocolate?
Will she be coming to meet you at the airport on arrival?
A taxi seems like a good idea!
As for me, I’ve planned to meet some friends who live there.
I’m mainly going to see them, but also to enjoy the city and everything it has to offer.
Have a good trip too!
Have fun with your daughter!
Oh, I know.
But being a bit stressed when flying isn’t something rational, you know.
There’s really something unnatural about such a big, heavy object as a plane being suspended 10 kilometres above the ground. 
Oh, don’t!
Yet, it’s different - being far from Earth, without gravity.
You’re not in danger of falling, since there isn’t really and up and a down.
No, in fact in space it’s more like in a submarine.
The spaceship has to be solid, because if there’s a little hole in the hull then you’d certainly be dead very quickly.
Like in a submarine.
It’s silly, but I think I’d be less scared.
Yes, definitely.
Anyway, it’s not really fear
More a kind of stress.
But how about you? Doesn’t it stress you out at all?
Even when there’s turbulence?
I agree with you there - it’s fun.
But it’s also incredibly stressful for people like me.
We’ll see!
Thanks for your support anyway.
I don’t really know.
It depends on where we organise it.
If we do it at mine, I can’t invite more than 15 people.
We could, you’re right.
And the neighbour on the 3rd floor is quite good-looking!
Have you seen her?
We could even ask people to bring stuff, couldn’t we?
Food or drink, for that matter.
We can buy plastic plates. It’ll be easier, don’t you think?
The same goes for the glasses and cutlery.
We can provide basic stuff like crisps, wine, beer and cold meats.
Then we’re sure not to die of hunger.
Ok for the plates.
No, there’s no use complicating things with a theme.
Are any of our friends vegan or vegetarian?
I agree.
Right, we can also provide raw vegetables. Everybody likes them.
Right, I think we’re off to a good start.
I’ll think about the guest list.
I have to go now, but thank you for your advice!
Hello Madame.
Lie down, I’m listening.
No problem, stay seated.
What are you worried about?
So let’s start with simple questions.
Were you already worried before coming into my practice?
Please do talk a lot.
It’s important for me to analyse your anxiety.
If you’re not anxious in my practice, that’s a good start: it means that you’re not scared of talking about yourself.
It’s an important step!
Since when have you been feeling all this anxiety?
In your opinion, what made you scared?
The responsibility?
Fear of failure?
Something else?
Hmm… How do your fears make themselves known? 
Right, the issue seems serious.
I therefore suggest that we see each other once a week for 6 months.
Today will be $150.
Oh no, I don’t believe it!
I have to go and collect my children in 5 minutes.
I need to let the school know I’m going to be late…
Is it an important meeting for you?
If you send a message to the secretary she’ll let them know.
Oh, do you want me to lend you my telephone?
Oh yes of course.
What shall we tell them then?
You could say we’re coming back from Los Angeles and that our plane got delayed?
I could call them, have them think that I’m your secretary and that you asked me to let them know?
That’s true!
I’ll call them straight away. So, what’s the number?
I have my computer in my rucksack. As I told you, I was going to leave to collect my children from school and I was thinking of working from home this evening.
We’ll find their number in my computer, don’t worry.
Here it is - I’ll give it to you.
In the meantime, I’ll call the school to let them know I’m going to be a bit late.
Ah yes, it’s getting quite worrying.
I hope help will get here soon.
I think this forest path is leading us to a dead end.
It’s getting dark.
It’s a problem.
No, I don’t know the area.
Yes, I think it would be wiser to retrace our steps.
How long have we walking on this path?
Yes, I have a watch.
My phone is out of battery.
It’s already 8pm and it’s getting dark.
Do you have anything for dinner?
I think we’ve been walking for four hours on this path.
The problem is light.
We could get lost or stumble on something and get injured.
Yes, we have to hurry.
We should be careful where we tread.
And does your phone still have some battery?
Great, send them a text to let them know.
Yes, but use it sparingly, because it uses lots of battery.
Do you have any warm clothes?
With night falling, it could get cold pretty quickly now.
Let’s try to walk a bit faster to keep warm.
I think I still have some hot water in my bag.
Would you like a tea or coffee?
Ok, we’ll have some later.
Hello Madam, come and sit down if you wish to do so.
It’s normal. Relax and you’ll quickly see that everything’s fine.
The best thing would be if you tell me why you wanted to come to see me.
But you can talk to me about other things too.
It's as you wish.
Can you tell me more?
Have you told him that clearly?
What do you do for a living?
I understand.
His situation doesn’t make it easy for him to put himself in your shoes, since his days must be quite relaxing.
He clearly counts on you a lot.
And I suppose he gets a bit bored during the day and would like you to be more available in the evening.
It doesn’t sound like it’s you who needs changing.
But more like him who needs to understand the issues with your work and support you when it’s difficult.
You could tell him about how you feel, tell him that you’re tired and that you need him help, give him a reason to do so.
Hello, it’s the first time I’ve seen you here!
Yes, it’s very nice. I like coming to this area. It’s calm and peaceful.
Thank you, I tripped!
I wanted to take a closer look at the ducks. They’re so cute!
He’s called Fetna. It’s a long story.
I like walking him here. Have you ever been in the wood next to us?
It’s quite simple actually.
She was born the same day as the National Holiday and so we agreed to call him “Fetna”, after what’s written in the calendar.
It’s stupid, but my parents and I found it funny.
Good job they didn’t follow the same principle when naming their children!
No, it’s just that if they had been set on choosing the Saint from the calendar on our birthdays like with the dog, that could have led to quite original names, or ugly ones! 
Imagine being born on Saint Ignatius’ day, or Ascension Day.
Perhaps that doesn’t mean much to you if you’re not very familiar with the religious calendar, sorry.
Don’t get too near!
It's really a beautiful place.
Do you live far from here?
Wait, I have to go catch my dog.
Chef, we have an order for two sole meunières. What type of butter shall I use?
And what type of vegetables shall we serve with the fish?
Beans chef?
I would serve the sole with tagliatelle instead.
What do you think?
No, potatoes don’t go with fish, I don’t think.
Instead serve the sole fillets on a bed of vegetables.
What do you think, chef?
Potatoes plus pasta seems like a lot.
I’m going to serve the sole on a bed of fennel instead.
What shall I suggest for the wine?
A white or a rosé?
After sole, I think a light dessert would be a good idea.
Either a lemon cart or rum pineapple. What do you think, chef?
Difficult to choose.
Personally I would go for pineapple slices flambéed in Armagnac.
What do you think?
That’s nice of you but I’d prefer a coffee.
With sugar. But ideally I’d like a caipirinha!
Yes, a very tough day.
We lost an important contract and we don’t know why.
Yes, of course we got some explanations.
According to them, we didn’t meet all their technical demands.
And we were too expensive.
Errrrm… archery?
That’s quite original.
Can we do it nearby?
I’ve never done it before.
Yes, I was asking if we can do archery nearby.
Archery is quite a tiring sport.
I would rather stay by the pool.
Oh I like the idea of climbing!
Whereabouts in the region might we able to do it?
Ok, but is there a guide to help us?
I would like to try climbing but I was wondering if it wouldn’t be better to stay here quietly by the pool.
Tomorrow I might feel a little braver to go climbing with you.
Oh but I would like to go climbing with you, just not today.
And how about doing a few lengths in the pool?
Yes, you’re right.
We have the pool to ourselves!
No problem.
I’m sure to win.
Come on, let’s go!
Is everything ok?
Are you ill?
Do you want me to call the stewardess?
Where are you going?
Are you off on holiday?
Is it for work?
What’s your presentation about?
Perhaps you have the time to think about it now.
I find that you can work very well here.
Once you’re above the clouds, everything is calm, there’s light… you get lots of ideas.
And flying is a real safe means of transport.
The safest even, they say. (Especially when travelling in the air!)
Wait!
They serve excellent petits fours after take-off. 
Do you like petits fours?
I take the plane every week.
Sometimes even several times a week.
It’s really very enjoyable.
And today’s crew is one of my favourite.
They know me well.
They always give me extra cakes.
I can ask for some for you as well.
Stay! You’ll see - it’s not as horrible as you think.
It’s very enjoyable!
You’ll be proud of yourself when you get there!
Oh, why here’s the stewardess!
Christine, would you be able to give me and my friend a little cake in advance?
It’s her first flight and I told her about your amazing petits fours.
So, is it good?
Oh!
We’ve taken off and you didn’t even notice.
Look how pretty the clouds are from above!
Ok, tell me why you’re here.
What has wearing glasses got to do with these brutal acts?
But that doesn’t tell me what glasses have to do with it all.
Maybe it’s his glasses that are horrible!!
I think you may need to look at your French again.
Your remarks don’t seem very coherent and I don’t understand what you’re expecting of me.
You could offer glasses to all the students?
Ok, then offer contact lentils to your student?
Is that still silly?
Well, it does depend on the shape of his glasses.
For example, if the frames are round, then perhaps the round shape is what’s annoying the students rather than the glasses themselves.
Maybe it’s giving them the impression they’re going round in circles?
Oh no, not at all, it’s a play on frames.
One question, Sandra: do you wear glasses?
Right, I acknowledge that the problem is a real headache and requires careful consideration.
I suggest we leave it at that for the evening and pick up the question later on.
I’m glad to have spoken with you and am impressed by the insightfulness of your remarks.
There are lots of ducks this year.
Do you think the work they’ve done recently next to the other ponds could have led the other ducks to migrate to this pond?
You’re right. Perhaps they’re strange ducks, which preferred to live in the company of horses.
It’s true that I don’t know that type of duck with the green collar.
Do you think that the ducks’ migration is due to socio-economic factors?
Perhaps pollution has increased?
That’s true for short-term decisions, but I don’t think that the current political decisions can already be said to have had an effect on nature.
Oh but I don’t support Trump at all.
I’m staying pragmatic with respect to ducks.
And bees!
I’m very worried about the disappearance of bees…
I know someone who didn’t like dolphins because they don’t have whiskers.
They liked cats because they did have whiskers.
Moustaches are what certain men wear between their mouths and noses.
And cats, whatever their gender, have whiskers they use to find their way around a room.
You must have strange cats if they drink cognac.
My cat won’t even drink soya milk, so cognac…
No, I’ve never been by here before, but perhaps we can try to get out by continuing in the same direction.
Isn’t moss always meant to grow Northwards?
At the very least, we can randomly choose and we’ll eventually come across some houses.
Yes, I always have water in my bag.
Are you thirsty?
Yes, here you go.
And if we’re stuck here too long, we can always try to make alcohol out of blackberries.
I’ll have a coffee please!
An Americano would be perfect!
With a little glass of water on the side.
No milk thank you.
Is it Happy Hour already?
In that case, I’ll have a little mojito…
A long day…
Hence the coffee and the mojito…
My boyfriend will be joining me.
I thin he’ll have a mojito too.
What?  No…. I’m a woman…!
My work clothes and my short hair may give cause for doubt…
But I’m currently working as an engineer on a big worksite and I didn’t have the time to go home and get changed or to take a shower after a day on-site…
I understand better now!
So there’s going to be a stag do in the bar tonight?
That could get lively!
How did we get here?
I’m cold.
And hungry.
A good 3 hours ago.
No you need it too.
I remember we passed in front of a hut.
We need to find it again.
Great.
You’ve thought of everything!
Let’s try to keep the water and biscuits for later.
Unfortunately no.
By the way, do you have your mobile?
I don’t have much battery left.
And there’s no signal.
Wait!
Which direction does the sun set in?
What I’m asking you to do is a team project, with other students.
You must form groups of three students.
And together prepare a chemistry experiment to present orally to the other students.
The equal distribution of tasks is one of the elements I will be evaluating.
You have fifteen days to prepare the work before the presentation date.
And on the day of the experiment, ten minutes of experimentation and ten minutes for your oral presentation with slides.
I don’t think that will be possible, as it wouldn’t be very fair with respect to the other students.
Think of a very simple experiment!
The aim is above all to learn to work in a team and to give you an experience of presenting orally.
So, the mark is out of thirty points.
Ten points for the experiment itself.
Ten points for the oral presentation that follows.
And ten points for your ability to work as a team.
Let’s get out of the room quickly!
I’m going to have a look across the corridor, but I fear it might be Mr. Dupont, the other chemistry teacher…
He often does new experiments, but he’s already set the fire alarm off twice…
Why, do you get scared during takeoff?
Is it your first time taking the plane?
It’s a very safe means of transport. There’s no need to panic.
Planes are built to resist strong turbulence.
Don’t worry too much.
You should try to doze a little. It’ll help calm you down.
Or have a glass of champagne!
That works well too.
Yes, regularly for work - I’m a business manager and have to visit lots of countries.
How about you? Why are you travelling?
Ah, nice.
And do you often go to visit them?
How old are your grandchildren if it’s not too indiscreet?
I understand.
I have grandchildren too. And what are you planning to do with them in Paris?
Take them to the circus?
That’s quite all right.
Let’s clarify your difficult together.
Do you constantly think about the ice-cream that’s eaten?
Or a mirror to look into?
So you have an irrepressible desire to eat ice-cream.
Are there particular circumstances in which the desire is stronger?
Especially at night?
That’s very interesting…
Do you dream that you’re eating ice-cream during the night before waking up and eating it?
So you eat ice-cream in your sleep?
Tell me about your childhood.
Have you had a bad experience with ice-cream?
A hidden trauma perhaps?
The story’s very interesting.
Because it could indeed be the starting point of your trauma.
Do you happen to eat mostly white or beige-coloured ice-cream, which could be suggestive of snow?
Well, well, we’re making progress… I suggest that you tell me more at our next session.
Of course.
But let’s take a look at the instructions to follow in the event of the lifting stopping between floors.
I’m pushing the call button.
Me too, but as I’m very weighed down, I took the lift and I’m regretting it, especially as they’re expecting me too, and my mobile doesn’t have any signal.
Since we’re sharing this unexpected moment together, explain to me what you’re working on at the moment.
I’m sure you’re doing your best.
The big event you organised last year went splendidly.
We’re all working a lot, especially at the moment, to prepare for this event.
I hope you can take a few days off after our feedback meetings and enjoy some time with your family.
I’ll think about what you’ve just said.
If everything goes as well this year as last year and we get some more clients, I’ll recommend to management that your team’s performance, and especially yours, be rewarded.
I can’t promise anything by myself.
Any decisions concerning staff are always made collectively with management and human resources. 
But I’ll suggest they review your situation.
But I find help is very long time coming.
I’m going to push the call button again.
Help refers to the people capable of moving the lift to a floor and of getting the doors open to free us.
I’m not sure I understood correctly.
What are you excited by?
Of course, I can help you organise your party!
With pleasure!
Do you have any specific ideas?
I know several bars that could accommodate 30 people.
Do you want a particular atmosphere?
That brings to mind a bar I know, which is really charming.
With really nice jazz background music.
And they do excellent meals.
Yes, it’ll give the opportunity to see whether the place is suitable.
And to discuss the money side of things.
But also the menu.
It’s possible in that bar.
They provide a savoury buffet with cold meats, cheese and wine, and you can bring a dessert for afterwards!
Leave off!
No telephone no instagram, no instagram no advertising for our lovely little dishes!
I’ll go up, but I’m keeping my telephone, so there!!
Dearie me no!
No garlic.
It gives me bad breath.
And with bad breath, there’s no way I’m showing my face in public.
I’ll prepare the pepper and take a photo of them.
New followers for me!!!!!!
Hahaha
But that’s not fair!
I’m a sous-chef in the kitchen, but a Commander-in-chief when it comes to public relations!
Perfume, photos and reception all suit me better than ending up at the stove!
I refuse!
I mean: I refuse to cook with garlic!
My beautiful shirts will reek!
You’re cruel!
What have I ever done to you?
The waitress aren’t very interesting, but the customers are!
I have to earn myself followers!
I’m a star on Instagram and other social networking sites!
A star!!
Me going to the toilet gives me 2000 likes.
I’m only doing this job whilst waiting to be recruited by a modelling agency!
I’m a star!!
A STAR!!!!!!!
Very good!
I’m going to work.
I’m going to work at Chanel and step down immediately from this rubbish day job! 
Frankly, using garlic isn’t fitting for someone of my calibre!
Farewell!
Hello, can I get you something?
Yes of course!
What alcohol do you like?
I think a tequila sunrise is actually what you need!
But have something to eat with it.
Our chips are delicious.
And they’re homemade of course!
They’re a rugby team celebrating their win.
They’ll probably stay late.
They’re noisy, but very nice.
They’ll help you take your mind off things after your hard day!
Yes, it’s very likely!
After a couple of drinks, they’ll surely be up for karaoke!
Yes we often have a go.
It helps create a good atmosphere!
But we start a little later in the evening.
Probably about 9pm.
Good evening Miss!
What type of gin do you have?
Oh sorry, I didn’t see you there. Good evening, sir!
There isn’t much light in here, and from behind your long hair threw me off.
Anyway, what gins have you got?
Is that all?
Ok, never mind.
I’ll have a gin tonic please.
Are you new here?
And what else do you do?
Are you a student?
That’s fascinating!
Which area of philosophy do you specialise in?
I did a bit of philosophy myself many years ago.
But I was more interested in questions linked to consciousness, ontology and phenomenology.
But you can’t study everything, can you?
What do you mean by “the point”?
Please do, I’m paying.
And I’ll have another gin tonic; I’ve already finished mine.
So you’ve studied Sartre?
Yeah why not.
What have you got?
A bit of everything would be perfect.
Do you work here every day?
Good night, and thanks for this evening!
I’m bored.
Shall we go play bowls?
We’ve been looking at the people round the pool for two days.
And there aren’t many interesting people.
You’ve met lots of people, have you?
Great, bingo.
I hope there’ll be a chicken to be won.
Bingo’s a bit naff. It reminds me of the village festival.
Ah yes, I’d do that.
No, come. Now that you’ve suggested it, it’s too late!
I’ll order cocktails
Forget your work. You’ve slept enough.
You need to take your mind of it. Holidays are just the trick for that.
Come on, get up. You’re not going to drink lying down.
You need to get to the bar.
Cool.
The mojito is here.
I ordered an orange juice.
I’m sensible.
Sensible.
So, that game of bowls?
Shall we go?
Great.
Let’s go investigate. I wouldn’t mind doing some aqua-pony.
I hope you were able to have a rest.
I hope you were able to have a rest.
See you next time!
I don’t have any battery left, sadly!
I don’t have the map anymore. I lost it earlier.
Yes, that’s a good idea, but we don’t have a tent.
Have you seen anywhere nearby we can take shelter?
Yes, let’s hope so.
Unfortunately, I fear I may have spied a wolf or a big stray dog earlier.
As for the flint, I have a box of matches in my left pocket.
I’m going to make a fire to scare them off. In exchange I wouldn’t mind eating at least one of the ham sandwiches.
Would you like some tea or coffee?
I’ve got some hot water left in my flask.
Great!
Do you have any sugar?
The wolf howling?
My matches are all wet, oh no!
However, I can hear voices nearby and I think I can just make out a torch.
Do you want to play a game?
You’re not going to stay here doing nothing!
It’s normal for you to be hot - you’re in the sun.
Ok, I’ll go get you a drink.
Do you want some water?
Here’s your gin tonic, but you shouldn’t drink in the sun.
You could get drunk quicker. It could even be dangerous to go swimming!
Yes I think there are sandwiches.
Oh!
Ok!
Here’s your sandwich!
Whilst I was making your sandwich, I made one for myself too.
It’s nice of you to ask!
Badminton!
It’s my favourite sport.
Horrible?
What happened?
It’s still not a good reason to take it out on our cat!
I see… it was just one difficulty after another…
Did you manage to take part in the meeting anyway?
Oh yes, I noticed the glasses, but I didn’t have to drive, so it didn’t bother me too much.
You think they were making fun of you?
I’m not sure!
Perhaps having to improvise without documents made you more concise.
And since you know the topic so well, you must have been perfect!
No I’m sure - I’m telling you.
Well, I think you had a very bad day and that you’re just in a bad mood…
That’s not true - you’re not always in a bad mood… although tonight you sure are!
Although after the day you’ve had, it’s understandable.
I had a good day myself…
That’s most likely why I see things more level-headedly.
Leave the poor alone alone, will you! Have a glass of wine instead - there’s still some left.
Yes.
I take it quite often!
Almost every week for work.
You’ll see, the journey will be ok, I’m sure of it.
It’s totally normal. It’s them filling up with fuel before take-off!
I too used to be scared when I started flying 10 years ago.
And I even took a course in learning not be scared of flying!
That’s a good way to relax!
But I’ll take a coffee instead…
I got up early this morning to get the plane, and I need a coffee to help me wake up a bit!
I could do with a croissant with the coffee.
I’m a chocolatier, and travel all over the world in search of the best chocolate…
That’s for sure!
But since I’m a bit of a food lover, I tend to eat croissants quite often.
Yes, it’s a fantastic job!
I'm self-employed, and so work for myself.
Ah, 8’s order’s just in.
The starter’s just two melon soups.
You do remember the recipe, don’t you?
It’s very simple.
Take a melon, cut it in two, take out the seeds and scoop out the melon pulp with a spoon.
Put the pulp into the blender.
Then what do you put into the blender?
Good.
Add some mint leaves.
Exactly.
So then you blend it and it’s almost ready.
All that’s left is to dish up.
Take your emptied melon halves.
Cut a little bit of rind off the bottoms so that they sit steady on the plate.
Pour in the soup and put a mint leaf on top as decoration.
What do you think?
No no, it’s not worth it.
It’s good as it is, light and fresh!
Send it into the dining room.
Next order…
A marinated salmon dish.
It’s easy that one!
Shall I leave you to it?
I didn’t understand that question.
What do you want to say about the topping?
Absolutely.
Yes, it’s a good idea.
Do that and send it in.
Have a safe journey home, and see you tomorrow!
Hello, I’ll have a coffee with an orange juice please.
No thank you, no milk in my coffee and no ice in the orange juice.
No thank you.
Just a coffee.
A chicken tart?
That’s very original.
Probably delicious, but I’d rather just have a coffee and an orange juice.
Chicken with cream?
Very surprising!
Sorry, but the dog in question isn’t mine!
It doesn’t bother me at all to have a dog with us.
He’s most likely better with us than outside.
Do you think your dog would like chicken tart?
Not sure.
Your coffee isn’t bad.
I also asked for an orange juice.
Hi!
By the way, it’s my birthday.
Do you want to help me organise something?
Great!
Thanks!
I was thinking of doing it next Saturday.
Maybe in a restaurant?
Oh damn!
My birthday’s today but I thought there would be more people at the weekend.
We could move it to Sunday?
Erm… I don’t know… I like Indonesian restaurants.
Do you happen to know a good one?
It usually isn’t too expensive…
If it’s not too expensive, I could perhaps pay for the drinks and everybody could pay for their own food they’ve ordered…
But I don’t really like Italian restaurants…
Do you know an Indonesian restaurant?
Or at a push Thai?
We could invite our yoga group and the people from choir.
A Thai restaurant.
I think there’s one by the old harbour.
I’ll find out.
Can you contact the yoga group and the choir?
Oh no!
The small Tuesday group.
As you know, there are only eight of us on Tuesdays.
We don’t know the others as well.
So, I’ll handle the restaurant and you invite our friends, and we’ll discuss it again tomorrow?
Oh!
What a great idea!
You don’t mind, do you?
Yes of course - it’s high time you introduce me to him!
Great, let’s do that!
And we could cook together in the morning.
I can’t wait!
Shall we discuss it tomorrow to finalise everything?
Great!
See you tomorrow!
Hey, have I seen you before by this pond?
Wasn’t it yesterday?
Me too. I like coming to this park often.
I find the place really calm.
I think there’s a football match planned today between the different parts of town.
It could quickly become unbearable.
I think the new municipal staff want to encourage exchanges.
Not even that.
Just children from different parts of town.
Right.
So the children from the west of town can meet those from the east of town.
It’s true that security problems have increased.
That’s true.
We all have to coexist.
When you were born here, it’s difficult to go to another country.
You lose your bearings entirely.
For example.
Or the choice of your doctor.
Finding an efficient new doctor isn’t easy when you move towns.
Or even finding a supermarket that sells products you’re used to.
Yes of course!
I think we should go to the park nearby. We can have a barbecue.
Oh no, it’s just us!
I’m not planning on inviting the Queen of England!
Or the new royal couple, haha!
Yes, it’s going to be lovely!
You’ve given me an idea: let’s do a royal barbecue!
Regal dress code required.
Yes, why not!
I’m going to make cakes for dessert.
I don’t know if the dinner will be as beautiful as the one at Windsor yesterday but we’ll give it a go!
Yes a chocolat cake, and an apple one I think.
What did you have?
Lucky!
Do you think I should do that?
Yes, I think I’m going to wear a beautiful solid gold tiara with lots of diamonds!
It’ll be really beautiful.
I was talking about dessert, but I think I’m going to do something more simple!
Speaking about meat and fish, I’m also going to get some things for the vegetarians.
You never know!
Yes, too right!
Perhaps you could bring a sword, like a real knight of the crown!
Haha!
Ok, let’s do that then!
Thanks for your help and see you at the weekend then!
Hello.
The day started well.
Yes, I got to have lunch.
In the garage.
My car broke down this morning.
In between two meetings.
No, I had to walk home.
A real nightmare.
Not very much, but the replacement part has to be ordered.
About 200 euros.
If only that was it.
Whilst running to catch the bus, I twisted my ankle.
I was going to call a taxi.
And when he saw that I was soaked through, he refused to let me get in.
So that pissed me off.
I started to shout at him.
So I started to feel better.
Insults.
Did you manage to get all the ingredients for the salmon with dill and the beef bourguignon?
But you told me you were going to the market this morning!
So we don’t have the ingredients?
We have 5 hours before tonight’s meal.
We can go to the supermarket and see what they have.
I’m sorry, I misunderstood…
I’ll dash off and I’ll be back with what I find!
I'm back!
I found a salmon and some beef cheeks.
Will that do?
I ran.
I used to run quite a bit during sixth form.
I’m starting the sorrel sauce.
That would be strange… do you think it could be good?
Oh, yes, we could make a salmon en croute, couldn’t we?
It would be quicker and it always looks fancy!
Yes, we’re going to manage it!
It’s your birthday.
What would you like to do?
Ah yeah, the 80’s, what a great idea!
We need to find all the hits we listened to back in the day!
I should still have my cassettes somewhere…
That’s not a bad idea.
There must be playlists… I can look for music this evening.
I think that Marc uses Spotify a lot.
He loves hits from the 80’s and 90’s.
Perhaps he’s got some playlists he compiled himself.
I’ll ask him.
Obviously a cake!
That’s a must!
I could make you one if you want.
I love baking.
We could make a cake with glittery icing - like a 80’s style disco!
For that matter, we definitely need dancing!
Oh yes!
I remember back in the day that we made one out of polystyrene and pieces of broken mirror.
We could do a decoration workshop on Sunday morning. That way everything will be ready for the party the following Saturday.
Oh no, here we go again!
And yet I pay a fortune for the upkeep of these machines!
I’m surrounded by incompetent people.
I mean, I didn’t mean that about you…
Do you know who you’re talking to?
My absence will be quickly noticed.
But we’ll press the SOS button.
I hope they repair it quickly. I’m claustrophobic.
Whoa, be polite!
If you continue like that, things are going to work out badly for you.
Go on, tell me more…
Stop immediately!
Listen carefully:
As soon as this ruddy lift is working again, you’re going straight to see the head of human resources.
You’ll hand him your resignation.
You will then go clear your desk and you will be gone by this evening.
I never want to you see you again in my company.
Ever!
No you can’t eat them!
They could be toxic!
I’m a bit scared.
If night falls and we don’t find our way, I’m going to cry!
And what if a wolf appears?
Dogs yes, but not wolves!
We’re going to find somewhere safe to sleep tonight.
I have matches!!
I hope we’re not going to be cold.
But it gets cooler in the evening.
Right, I’m going to lie down and look at the stars.
No, I meant that it’s cooler in the evening than during the day.
And tomorrow we’ll find the way home.
Suits me!
Where are the onions?
I’m waiting for the onions.
I shouldn’t have to wait!
Are they still raw?
I asked you five minutes ago to chop them and fry them in a pan!
Are you kidding me?!!
You’ll need to learn to obey me and be efficient, otherwise I’ll quickly find myself another assistant.
Don’t heat them too much!
They’ll burn.
Where did you learn to cook?
Very good.
Now take care of the sauce.
I hope you can do that all by yourself.
You should have told me beforehand!
No, we do not  have “free” sauce!!!
But we do have salt-free sauce.
Do you have any ideas about how to make a salt-free sauce that’s good anyway?
That’s my girl!
Did you remember to bring the bread for the ducks?
I’ve just got a pack of cigarettes.
Do you think they would eat little pieces of tobacco leaves?
Yes, of course!
A cat and two budgies.
What does that have to do with anything?
Of course not!
I’m not stupid - they’re my pets. I feed them correctly!
But those are just ducks.
Well, I can tell that you don’t want to try it out.
No worries. We could take a walk in the park?
Don’t worry!
This park’s nice, when the weather’s good like this.
We should go for walks here more often. It feels good.
Yes, we do spend too much time in front of the TV.
We know it, but keep doing it.
It’s a bit stupid.
Well we keep watching TV, even if we know that we spend too long doing it.
5 minutes chef. I’m starting cooking.
Damn, I’ve burnt the steaks.
Yes well hurry up then.
You need to add more cream
to the pasta
and whatever you do, stop stealing peanuts!
At Bella Donna Mia we’ve never served rice.
For 5 generations.
Except for wartime.
Have you seen table number 2?
The couple of British tourists?
They want jelly.
Excellent idea. I’ll change the menu.
Ha ha, we have to reinvent a recipe of pasta with jelly and snails.
How are you getting on with the dessert?
Is it getting there?
The water for the pasta!!!
That’s why it’s burning!
Best joke ever.
Not only that, pizza too.
Right, my shift’s up.
Ciao!
Hmm, I’m ok, I’m good here!
I would quite like to stay a bit longer lounging in the sun…
Meh, I don’t really have the energy at the moment…
And in any case you always win, because you cheat when counting the score!
This morning, yesterday, the day before yesterday…!
Anyway, never mind! At the moment it’s just that I don’t want to do anything…
Oh!
You’re just jealous because I’m better at cards than you!
Oh yes, that I would like!
You are nice though. I like you even if you’re a cheat!
Sorry?
Oh, I’d like a mojito please!
And can you tell the waiter not to rip me off with the amount of rum this time?
Ok, great!
I’ll continue my nap then.
I hope the cocktail will calm your enthusiasm for sport!
We’ll see about that!
Ok, I’m going to sleep, and thank you!
SURPRIIIIIIISE!!!!!!!!!
Happy birthday!!!!!
I don’t even know what that is.
A gin party?
That’s strange as a theme.
But it’s your birthday, we’ll do as you wish.
No problem for the desserts.
And for the 43 types of gin.
What were you thinking of in terms of decoration?
Well, I think that’s quite a lot of lemon, but otherwise no problem.
Concerning music, I’ve prepared a playlist I think you might like.
That’s a good to have thought about non-alcoholic stuff.
As for being outside, that’ll be great. I have marquee in case it starts raining.
Have you had a think about the guest list?
My dear, I think your liver is already suffering.
Mine too for that matter.
Your liver, sorry.
Yes, you know, those big tents you set up to shelter under during parties.
Hello Maria, how are you?
I told you you would get used to it!
It was just a question of time.
What have you been up to?
How do you spend your days?
Yes, you couldn’t stay all alone in that house.
You needed company.
So is there anything good happening at the moment?
Yes I’m happy.
Do the other residents share your opinions?
You!
Extreme!?
It’s completely backwards.
It must be difficult to have a calm conversation.
I know that I couldn’t do it.
Anyway, have you noticed, the sun’s come out again!
Do you fancy going out in the park in the coming days?
Hi!
I just got in.
How was your day?
It was tough!
The customers wouldn’t stop bothering me.
On top of that, a child came and insulted me!
I’m on edge.
Yeah, we could go and eat out.
But if money’s a problem, why not do a little home-cooked dinner?
How about a duck magret?
Yeah, I’m talking about a dish made from duck.
It’s very good.
And we could enjoy it with a glass of wine too, for example.
That’s perfect!
But since we both had such a hectic day, how about also preparing a nice dessert?
To soothe the soul and warm the heart.
I love frangipan!
It’s so good!
Ok, let’s do that.
And I’ll prepare a lovely chocolate fudge cake!
We can accompany it with ice-cream or custard.
Of course, we mustn’t forget to do a bit of sport during the week to burn it all off.
Bon appétit of course!
Erm… to be honest, I have a problem, chef…
I didn’t know how to tell you this… but I think I burned the cream.
I was doing as you asked, chef, but since I was busy making the starter for table 6, I didn’t see the time go by and I let the cream burn…
I think we’ll need to start again, or we tell them it’s a new avant-garde recipe.
Yes, I’m not feeling great at the moment… My dog is ill, my mother hits me, and on top of that I’ve got cockroaches in my flat!
But everything’s fine. I’ll redo the dessert, and I promise to be on time and to be more careful!
You can count on me, chef!
You’re very kind, chef.
However, sugar isn’t very good for dogs, you know.
He could get even more ill!
Oh, can I take a piece of meat instead?
It’s perfect for black eyes.
It’s true that I’ve only ever seen that in comics, but it must be true!
Do you want me to beat my mother?
Or is it a technique to get her to come and buy meat from us herself?
Erm, ok, if you want!
But if you give me a job as a clown, you’ll need to recrute another cook!
Good luck, chef!
It’s starting to be a while since we stopped moving.
What do you think?
Shall we call?
Yes I was thinking more about the alarm button.
I don’t have the number of anyone who could help us.
And what’s more, I don’t have any reception.
Right, I’m pressing it.
No better.
All we can do is wait now.
I had a meeting with Dubois at 2pm. I hate being late!
And you?
Are you going up to the sixth floor too?
Yes that meeting. It’s going to be complicated to set up and even more so if neither of us is there…
Well, never mind. It’s not as if we can take part from here.
Did you get my memo about the construction delays? 
Hello, I’d like something strong, please.
I need to calm down!
Yes a whisky, great.
I’ve just witnessed an accident.
A car ran over a cyclist.
I had to call the firemen. It was very distressing.
The car ran over his leg. He bled a lot.
But it wasn’t life-threatening.
Yes, cyclists are very vulnerable in town!
Yes, it’s a real shame!
There should be more cycle paths.
It would help reduce pollution at the same time.
Yes, you’re right.
Or in that case they should spray perfume on people as they go into work.
Yes, I did cycle a lot, but after the accident I’ve just seen I’m not sure I’m going to any time soon!
Yes, please!
Thank you.
I’m really happy: tonight I’m organising a party at mine!
I know I’m leaving it a little late in terms of organisation but… it’s my birthday!
I’d be really happy if you came!
Yes, as I’m a bit last minute, everything remains to be done!
A theme?
No, not yet, but it’s a good idea!
Black and white?
That’s a good idea!
But that’s perfect!
You could come round about 2pm to help me get everything set up?
The party will be tonight, but it could be nice to get everything ready together since you are full of good ideas!
For the moment, you’re the only person I’ve contacted.
I didn’t dare ask him.
Ok.
I’ll ask him.
At worst, he’ll say he’s not available…
Yes!
I do hope so!
Ok.
Let’s do that: I’ll contact my other friends and I’ll leave it to you to prepare black and white decorations!
Sir, may I ask you a question please?
I don’t understand why I only got 12/20 on the test.
I think it deserves more points than that.
Because I wrote 14 pages and I added lots of quotes.
I learnt lots of quotes by heart and I wrote as many as possible in my paper.
I get that, but even so, 12/20 for 14 pages. I don’t think it’s enough.
Otherwise, next time I’ll only write 2 pages, like Martin, who got 15.
It’s not fair.
He’s your favourite.
He always gets better marks than me, even if he writes any old rubbish.
He plays golf with you?
But that’s unfair!
You know him personally and therefore show favouritism towards him.
I think I’m going to speak to the Head. It’s not normal.
There must be other teachers who don’t play golf.
I can’t imagine Mrs Smith playing golf.
But she must be 20 years older than you!
Really?
I wouldn’t have thought it.
I thought she was younger…
Well, could you not increase my mark a little, even if I don’t play golf?
It’s unfair!
Your reputation won’t get any better.
Fine.
Goodbye, Sir.
Are you suggesting we play a game?
In which, according to where I hit the duck, I gain a variable number of points?
Have I understood correctly?
No, it’s the first time in my life I’ve played this game.
Then again, I’ve been living in Iceland for years now.
And there aren’t any ducks, only sheep and horses…
Yes, it is!
In any case, they’re going to throw themselves at the bread!
Oh, have you seen? There are ducklings too…
They are really cute…
Oh no, they’re too cute…
We could think of changing the rules.
If you manage to coax 3 ducklings with the same piece of bread thrown into the water, then you win 20 points.
I wasn’t very clear.
The idea is to bring together three ducklings
using the same piece of bread.
That’s why the score is high…
20 points.
And it could be difficult to achieve!
Hello Madam.
Come and sit here.
How can I help you?
Has something in particular happened recently?
A disappointment, a failure?
Or on the contrary nothing in particular, just an unfulfilling routine?
What would you like to do?
Do you eat enough?
Nutrition can have a very large effect on how you feel, you know.
Perhaps you should go to see a nutritionist to help you organise your nutrition better.
I’m sure that would help boost your energy levels and help you feel better.
What sport would you like to do?
Is it a sport you have played before?
Yes of course.
Just opposite is Dr. Jekyll’s surgery. He’s an excellent nutritionist.
And he’s a good friend of mine too!
No, not at all.
But people often make that joke with him.
You can too. He’s used to it.
He has a good sense of humour!
I’m delighted.
But yes, we’re going to have to call it a day there.
It’s time for my next patient.
Enjoy the rest of your day.
And please keep me updated on your progress nutrition-wise.
See you soon!
What’s wrong with you?
What made you want to put your shoes in the oven?
Were they sports shoes or formal shoes?
Maybe the pills are strong.
How long has it been since you started taking them?
Well, you can expect side effects like sleep or memory problems, but cooking your shoes is another matter.
Because either you’ve got an acute problem with perception (you mistake your shoes for a cake for example), or you’re experiencing a loss of concentration, or you really wanted to burn your shoes.
What did you talk about with your mother?
If you go to a party, I suggest you don’t cook.
Do you go out with your friends often these days?
Do you do any sport?
Yes, absolutely, I see.
I think putting your shoes in the oven is a sign of strong emotions that you can’t seem to express otherwise.
I therefore advise you to: do a regular CALM sporting activity (jogging for example), lock your oven and eat cold meals to avoid an accident in your building, and to start acting.
At the same time, we’ll halve your dosage of pills.
We should have reached the road ages ago. I get the feeling we’re lost.
Do you have the map?
Wait, I’ll take a look in my bag.
Ok, I can’t find the map…
But there is some chocolate left. Do you want some?
Look!
It’s good, isn’t it?
Yes, we can try to go down there…
We should be able to get to the river, and the river flows towards the village.
But it does make the journey longer…
And it’s already late - the sun’s starting to go down.
We need to hurry!
Once you leave the path, you enter the wild beast territory.
And the sun is setting. It’s certainly  the perfect time to meet a wolf or a bear!
We really need to get back quickly.
It’ll be safer beside the river.
I prefer not to think about it.
Watch out! There are roots everywhere. We wouldn’t want one of us to get hurt on top of everything!
Ah, I think we can see the river down there.
We’re saved!
Great!
I ate three frogs and two snails.
No, for lunch.
But it’s the butter that goes with them that’s good.
And how about you?
I think I’m seeing double.
When I see green, I also see red.
Is it serious, doctor?
It’s temporary, but intense.
When I look at a green pepper, it often turns into a red chili pepper.
It’s distrurbing.
It’s only from time to time.
Every now and then.
Bu these colour inversions can last for several hours.
And it’s really annoying, since I’m in change of traffic lights.
Do you think it comes from my childhood?
I’ve been seeing double for about 5 years.
I don’t know of any similar problems in my family.
Except perhaps my great-grandfather but he drank heavily.
Thank you for your advice.
Yes, I’m going to change doctors.
You’re totally right. I’ll try to call reception.
They should be able to help us out.
Oh no, we don’t seem to have any signal here.
I won’t be able to call.
Does this lift have an emergency call system?
Ok, I’ll see whether that’s it.
Perhaps you can see whether your phone’s got any signal.
We might not have the same operator.
Yeah, this big red button does look promising.
Are you ok for me to push it?
I’ll take that as a yes.
It’s raining. Maybe somebody will talk to us.
Oh, it stopped.
Are you sure this lift is maintained correctly?
It stopped ringing. I don’t think anybody’s going to reply.
I wouldn’t dare to accuse you of anything.
You’re not responsible for repairing the lift!
Well, in a way you are…
But that’s not what I meant.
Anyhow… you see what I mean.
Have you checked whether your phone has any reception?
Well, we’ll just have to wait until somebody realises that the lift’s out of order and goes to get somebody.
It’s great here, enjoying the sun!
It feels good to relax.
Ok, but I’d like to relax for a few more minutes.
Where do you want to go afterwards?
Great!
And you you think we’ll come across any other animals?
Wildlife is meant to be very rich here.
How was the visit to the temple yesterday?
I haven’t visited any yet myself.
But I can’t wait to discover them.
It’s so interesting.
Oh, that’s a bit uncalled for saying that to me!
I’m just very tired and stressed by work. I need to relax.
Yes, with pleasure!
I’d be delighted to.
And you’re right. I need to get up and about more.
Ok then!
Let’s stay here next to the pool then.
But we can also go for a bit of a swim.
I like that plan.
And I hope I won’t be last!
Indeed.
I contacted maintenance straight after you spoke to me about it.
As soon as we get out of this lift, I’m going to get back in contact with them.
The idea being to see what’s been done and to understand why the lift has broken down again.
I overheard something about a young intern…
If it’s him they’re sending to do the repairs, that could be one lead to understanding why the lift’s broken down again…
Let’s try the alarm button anyway!
Perhaps it’s been repaired.
Yes.
But I’m not sure that will be good enough…
Although I do have a bit of signal.
I’ll try to send a text to our colleague on reception.
It is very hot…
And what is more, I took the lift to go eat; I’m starting to get hungry…
I hope we’ll get out quickly!
No problem.
I’ll contact the team immediately.
Sorry?
Oh yes that’s right.
I had a really terrible day.
Nothing serious, it’ll pass.
I arrived late at work because of the strikes.
And I had that important meeting.
He left after waiting for a quarter of an hour.
And it was me who was presenting
this year’s results.
Well, since I didn’t have an audience
the meeting was cancelled.
They thought I was pulling a sickie.
And I had to justify myself all day.
I won’t get that promotion.
I had a simple goal and I’m not going to be able to put it right.
It’s a real shame.
All that work for nothing.
Where’s the bottle opener?
Hello, Miss.
Yes, of course.
I couldn’t find one on the way in.
I couldn’t find a bin on the way in.
There you go, it’s done now.
Not easy, but I think I did well.
The instructions weren’t clear.
What’s going to be in the exam?
I don’t use Facebook.
But I don’t work a lot at the weekend.
By principle.
However, you were lucky. I managed to do my homework in advance last Thursday
after the school party.
Oh really?
Well that’s funny. I live by the same principles as the entire class.
Oh but I do learn a lot.
Even if I go to bed late.
That’s true.
Yes, but the timetable isn’t practical.
I missed several of your classes because it was nap time.
I have principles, as I’ve told you.
I suggest you guarantee me a good mark this year and I’ll make an effort.
In any case equations are pointless.
I really liked the class on fluid mechanics, you know.
Oh sorry, my bad. It wasn’t with you.
Thank you, Miss. Can I sign the register first?
I missed my bus today.
There are strikes on at the moment.
And what’s more, you too were late yesterday.
You did the right thing taking the car.
The bus takes too long.
Has class started?
I had no problem with my homework yesterday.
Ok, do you have an exam paper and some sheets?
I forget my school things.
Yes, my classmates are all stuck.
What do you want us to work on today if we are alone?
Do you know if the physics teacher is here today?
Ok.
I like maps.
Which maps do you want us to work on?
Maps of each country and each continent in geography.
Thank you! Let’s revise then!
It’s stupid of us to have got lost when we had a good map!
Why did you give it to that family of goblins earlier?
Hmm. You only think with your stomach.
With the map we would have quickly found the shortest path to the best restaurant in the area.
No, I haven’t opened it yet. I’m a bit wary of it because of the rabbit skin wrapping paper and the really odd smell it’s giving off…
Oh, perhaps I’ve got the accompaniment to the fork!
Wait for it… victory!
It’s a very good camembert!
It means it’s been well made (from the verb “to do”) and that we’ll enjoy it even without bread.
And bent at that?
What does it mean?
We’ll eat the camembert using the fork’s handle. It’ll work.
As for the magic powers of this Norman cheese, how can you tell?
I suggest we eat the cheese with the handle of the fork that it won’t matter that it’s bent.
Then again, I don’t know how to bring out its magic powers.
Do you have any reception to call a taxi or one of our husbands?
Oh that’s cool, because my husband’s a troll and breaks all his phones.
Excuse me, can you hear that noise?
It’s strange, isn’t it?
The engine?
There are several, aren’t there?
i don’t know anything about planes, but I’m terrified whenever I fly.
I’m sorry to bother you like this, but I’m really scared.
Oh my god, but that’s a dreadful thing to say.
Do you really think so?
Or are you saying that to make fun of me?
I’m going to turn on my telephone to send messages to all my family, tell them I love them and that I’m about to die.
At least it’ll probably be instantaneous and painless, right?
I’m like most people: I don’t believe in God until 5 minutes before the end.
But having a drink is surely a good idea.
But nobody will serve us if we’re about to crash.
But you know we have no chance, don’t you?
We’re going to crash miserably in the middle of the ocean. 
We’ll be ripped to shreds, several kilometres underwater.
They’ll mention our crash in the newspaper.
You know, given where we’re falling from, it doesn’t make that much of a difference.
A parachute?
But why do you go carry a parachute around with you?
Are you sure?
Can it carry two people?
But, wait!
We’re going to land in the heart of Pakistan, right in the middle of tribal zones full of terrorists!!!
And to be honest, do you really think they’re going to open the door to let us jump out without stealing our parachute?
And I’m sure that there are people who deserve not to die more than me.
What?
Yes I can feel them very strongly…
It’s terrifying.
Go! Take two young children with you! Jump! I’m staying here.
All I ask is to be able to keep the bottle of red wine.
Ok, you’ve talked me round.
Right, let’s jump, and celebrate our survival with this wonderful Bordeaux, warm and dry in the Tora Bora caves!
Absolutely! I love curry!
Hello chef!
How are you this evening?
I’ve brought these tomatoes I found in the market this morning. I thought they could inspire you to make something that looks and tastes good. 
They’re of different sizes, colours and flavours.
Yes, no problem.
I’m going to start with the fennel. It takes the longest.
What’s the starter and today’s special this evening, chef?
They should like that!
And the special?
There’s the fennel.
I’m going on to the carrots.
Excellent.
It’s making me hungry!
I’ll peal the potatoes.
For the truffle, were you planning in cutting it into fine slices or just using the truffle oil?
Yes chef, no problem.
But are you sure there’s some Madeira left?
I can’t find it!
Ah yes, sorry.
I don’t know by heart where all the ingredients are yet…
And I think it’s the first time we’ve used the Madeira.
Yes, sorry, sorry.
Right, it’s on.
In the meantime, I’ll start preparing three guinea fowl.
Yes chef.
Oh I think the first customers are arriving.
It’s early!
Ok, it doesn’t matter.
We can have another look at it together.
Can you explain what you don’t understand?
If it’s not written in the title, then it’s up to you to define it.
In any case, to write your essay, you’ll need to start by defining the subject (stating, explaining and defining the topic).
Take an event.
It can be historic (for example the events of May 1968, which are being talked about quite a bit at the moment because it’s been fifty years) or the last presidential elections.
So the first thing to do is choose.
The viewpoint can be historical or sociological.
What happened at the time?
What was the political and societal fallout?
Or for example, how is it perceived nowadays?
How does the current generation view the events?
2,000 words.
Ok.
But you must respect the new deadline.
And your essay must be the best you’ve ever written…
Perfect.
Good luck.
You’re welcome.
If you have more questions or problems, don’t hesitate to come and see me again.
Goodbye.
I’ve come to see you because I don’t understand exactly what’s happening to me.
For the last couple of months, from time to time, I get the impression I’m hearing a voice talking in my head.
A little feminine voice, almost childlike, which sometimes gives a running commentary on what I’m doing.
It’s often to criticise me.
No, nobody I recognise.
Do you think I’m going mad?
No, nothing special I don’t think.
I’ve got a lot of stress at work, but that’s the case for lots of people…
Yes, my boss.
She’s very competent, but she’s quite uncompromising.
She doesn’t tolerate mediocrity well.
She’s very demanding.
Yes, exactly.
I’m talking about the head of my service.
Do you think my mind has created a virtual version of her and is making her talk in my head even when I’m not at work?
I work a lot, which allows me to work correctly, I think.
I reach my targets.
But it doesn’t stop my boss being hard on me when I’m a bit late or when I don’t do everything just as she wants.
But her criticism is always justified.
I admire her a lot.
I think we’re all stressed and at the same time we all admire her.
I told you, she’s a woman.
Very beautiful too.
Yes, most likely.
Oh I understand!
Ok.
What should I do?
Do you think I should take some holiday?
Ok, I’ll try to talk it about discreetly with those around me.
Don’t you think she’ll find it inappropriate?
Her door is closed, literally.
But if you have a good reason to need to speak to her, she’s always willing to talk.
Our conversations are formal and almost never informal.
It's a shame for that matter.
But she doesn’t drink coffee and doesn’t smoke, so she stays in her office all day.
I agree, but it should be up to her to organise it.
I’m just one of many employees in this department.
Hmm I see… But I’ve got nothing to celebrate.
I’ll speak with my colleagues about it. Perhaps one of them will soon have something to celebrate!
There are about fifty of us.
I’d say so.
We don’t really know the other managers on her level.
They’re managers of other departments.
But I’ll try to act on your suggestion: find a good reason to organise
(Sorry)
But I’ll try to act on your suggestion: find a good reason to organise drinks between colleagues, organise it and invite her!
Yes, thank you so much for your advice.
Phew, thank you. That’s reassuring.
I’ll try to take some a couple of days’ leave then.
I’m sure that I’ll feel better soon.
Yes, I’ll do that too.
And a camomile tea before going to sleep!
Sometimes we make fun of grandmas who drink camomile tea, but I must tell you, I like it myself!
Well, I think I have everything I need to solve the problem now!
Thank you!
Got it! Thanks again.
Enjoy the rest of your day, Doctor.
Ok!
Good idea!
See you soon.
Yes chef!
Into cubes or lengthways.
Do you want beetroot with that too?
Perhaps with some basil then?
Beetroot is good, but might give a sugary taste.
Perhaps we could add some cheese?
Ok for the English meal.
What size for the chips cut lengthways?
Yes, we can add olive oil with the beetroot.
They go well together I think.
Don’t you think?
Ok, perfect.
I first need to observe before getting things right.
What do you want with that?
How do you want the roast cooked?
It’s been 10 years.
Ok, I’ll prepare that.
Can I add celery too?
And long have you been a chef?
Ah yes, great.
Miss, will there be a test soon?
A test on the last chapter.
I’d like to know how long I have left to revise.
Ok, if I have any questions, can I ask you them by email?
Thank you Miss! I’ll try to do that!
Right, I’ve got my book and my essential oils… will that do?
It’s me not you who’s scared of flying, ok?
And I’m talking about essential oils.
A barrel of laughs…
In the meantime, my eucalyptus is stinking out the entire plane.
And what are we meant to do in the event of an accident?
Like, keep your arms inside?
There’ll be no inside at all!!!
We have to go see your stepmother, even if I’d have gladly avoided it…
And I hope the pilot is not suicidal.
I don’t want to see the Alps too close up…
Why is the plane moving like that?
It's pitching far too much to this side and the stewardesses look a little uneasy.
You can see they’re trying to stay calm.
They’re hiding something - I’m sure of it!
